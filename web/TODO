Let the package use the distro's smarty library and smarty-gettext.
Packages: smarty smarty-gettext
See if it works: dpkg --contents *smarty*
It installs these files:
/usr/share/php/smarty/Smarty.class.php
The gettext plugin should be right automatically since it installs itself in the plugin directory of Smarty.



You will need four directories setup for Smarty to work. These files are for
templates, compiled templates, cached templates and config files. You may or
may not use caching or config files, but it is a good idea to set them up
anyways. It is also recommended to place them outside of the web server
document root. The web server PHP user will need write access to the cache and
compile directories as well.

In our example, the document root is /web/www.domain.com/docs and the
web server username is "nobody". We will keep our Smarty files under
/web/www.domain.com/smarty

$> cd /web/www.domain.com
$> mkdir smarty
$> mkdir smarty/templates
$> mkdir smarty/templates_c
$> mkdir smarty/cache
$> mkdir smarty/configs
$> chown nobody:nobody smarty/templates_c
$> chown nobody:nobody smarty/cache
$> chmod 775 smarty/templates_c
$> chmod 775 smarty/cache





















To create a Debian package of Bibledit-Web.









Perhaps to use ckeditor and drop jwysiwyg/jquery - ckeditor is packaged in Debian, jwysiwyg is not.


















Add downloadable files. Let this backup tarball also include all downloadable files in /var/lib/bibledit-web, so that a restore can be made complete.
Also add the git repository on the web server. So that a restore makes this complete as well.
Test download.
















The tarball does everything on its own, so that the debian package does little extra.

Let the bibledit-web tarball use external resources instead of bundling its own.
Any missing sources should be put into Debian before disbundling them.

Let it use dbconfig-common

Use Dwoo instead of smarty? Switch to Zend views?
Pay attention to localization through Zend.























































I was pleased to see that I would be able to edit in the Web version using my Nook that has been rooted to become an Android 3.0 tablet. 
By enlarging the font with a gesture and turning the unit to the side, I was able to get the pages (both editable and the HTML exports) to reformat to fit the screen. 
However the verse editing window would not reformat. 
I wonder if you might be willing to make that window also variable in size. 
I think a tablet would make a good device for an MTT. 
I am using the MessageEase keyboard, and find that I am accurate at entering text with that, more than other keyboards.






Where it mentions this link: http://site.org/bibledit/setup.php
There should be the option given that if they are doing this on their local computer that the address will be
http://localhost/bibledit/setup.php































Producing a sword module.
Use usfm2osis.pl
If all .usfm files are in one folder data, do this:
perl usfm2osis.pl Bible data/*.usfm
This produces a file Bible.osis.xml.
Then make it a Sword module:
osis2mod . Bible.osis.xml
To write it to the proper place:
osis2mod ~/.sword/modules/texts/bibledit/ndebele Bible.osis.xml

osis2mod is conservative with file permissions.  
Be sure the files have proper permissions before you deploy.
I only mention this because I often forget to grant read access to files
before deploying a module for testing and the result is only
chapter/verse numbers.















CONFIGURING TOO EARLY:

Looking further at the autotools configuration done in bibletime-web
0.2, other things that need to be settable per-installation, not at
build time, are apparently also being configured and defined at build
time.  These include the database server location, database admin user,
database admin password, database name, database user, database
password, bibledit admin user and password. Some of these seem to be handled in
database/credentials.php and this is created by setup.php, but in that
case, why is the checking of MySQL at build time being done?

Why the code needs the mysql admin username and pw is a question in
itself -- wouldn't it be more secure to prompt for these when needed,
which hopefully is just for a one-time initial database setup, done at
(package) install time, not build time?

Since (at least in theory) one could set up multiple instances of
bibledit-web on a single server, each with their own database and each
with their own apache virtualhost, doing too much at build time seems to
me to reduce overall flexibility and capability.

Unless I am misunderstanding what the code does, I don't see how this
software can readily be packaged until many or all of these things are
moved from being defined and checked at build time to being settable in
a configuration file accessed (and checked, if appropriate) at run time.

DATABASE CREATION:

I think the setup.php code that creates the bibledit-web database
probably will need to be made usable as a script to be run at package
installation time, or maybe at first web login to bibledit-web.  Asking
users to point a browser at a URL just to do something non-interactive
seems unfriendly.  The web server needing to be able to delete the
bibledit-web php files (auto-deleting setup.php after running it) looks
like a security weakness; only the server admin should be able to edit
or delete those files, once installed.


SECURITY:

There is too much chmod -R 0777 going on (both in the Makefiles and then
also in some PHP code) than can be considered safe or secure for an
Internet-facing web server.  World writable files and directories are
almost never needed, and almost always a security risk.  Why would every
user on the web server machine need full access to all of these
bibledit-web files and directories?  Installed on a shared web hosting
server, this could quite easily allow other customers on that server to
do anything they like with your site, including add their own code, run
spambots as you, hand out malware to every unsuspecting user who uses
the bibledit-web site, etc.

I'm not sure that suggesting or assuming a MySQL root pw of "root" is
wise, either :)  If you are going to do setup from PHP, why not have
setup.php prompt for all the database info (host, dbname, adminuser,
adminpw, username, pw) and write some of it (hopefully not the
adminuser/adminpw!) to a config file?  It can do some of that already.

All uses of system() and exec() should probably specify a full path, so
users can't persuade your code to execute *their* chmod instead of the
system one, for instance.

I'd suggest you try to do a detailed security review as soon as
practical.  It seems odd to be using 1024bit ssh keypairs, but also
doing things like "chmod 0777" and assuming a dba password of "root".


SUMMARY:

As far as I can see, the bibledit-web 0.2 codebase pretty much requires
that it be built from source, locally for each individual installation.
 That is the exact opposite of what packaged software does (build it
once, then distribute the resulting compiled binary package around the
world) :)  Since bibledit-gtk doesn't require this
unique-per-installation build, I'm not sure why bibledit-web does, or
what the benefit of this approach is.  I rather suspect that in trying
to make things "friendly" for people installing it from source, the
software has been made hard or impossible to install as a package.




DATABASE CREATION vs DATABASE USE:

I am rather alarmed to find that the bibledit-web code seems to make no
distinction between the database user/pw needed to create the bibledit
database and its tables, at install time, and the one used at runtime to
work with those tables.  Am I understanding this correctly?

By default, this leads to the bibledit-web database code using the
all-powerful DBA user (root) at run-time, and storing that username and
*password* in plain text in a configuration file.  Worse still, the
default password is "root", and (even worse!) that configuration file is
set to mode 0777, so absolutely any user on the server can read it, and
then use it to do absolutely anything they want with any MySQL database
on that database server.

I believe this is a significant security issue.  On my web servers
(servers I admin, not servers I own!), a single MySQL server instance
can contain databases for 100-200 independently owned web sites... the
bibledit-web 0.2 installation in effect gives *every* user on the server
full access to *every* *single* *one* of those databases! (I didn't
install bibledit-web on a production server, so no harm done, I'm just
pointing out how bad this would be in production use!).

I think the right solution is for the code to distinguish very clearly
between (a) the DBA username and pw, and (b) the runtime
bibletime-specific user and pw.  (a) is prompted for and used only once,
at install time, to create the bibledit database and the runtime user
and pw. It is never stored anywhere on disk.  (b) is then used to create
the tables, and then to access the information in database, by
bibledit-web at runtime.  It is stored in a config file (readable only
by the user running the bibledit virtualhost, but not by others!).

I have not checked whether this issue is fixed in the latest git
development code; I probably should :)

LIBRARIES:

Is there a list somewhere of what libraries are needed by bibledit-web,
or are incorporated as copies (or modified copies) within it?  So far I
have found:

 * jquery
 * jwysiwyg (a plugin for jquery)

Are there any more?  At least the non-modified ones have to be packaged
separately, if packaged versions of them don't already exist.  








It would be helpful if bibledit-xiphos and bibledit-bibletime
show their version number somehow. Perhaps on the main window.
Or under the settings window.







Once the bibledit-web package is ready for deployment, we need to find 
a way to run both the production environment and the demo site on 
bibleconsultants.dyndns.org.






Should we upgrade bibledit-gtk to libgtkhtml-4.0-0 and libgtkhtml-editor-4.0-0? 
These might have better quality than the current library.
