The bibledit-web program is used editing work done during revising or
translating a Bible.


To install the bibledit program, read file INSTALL.



Git repository notes.
The git repository is in folder ".git".
There is file .git/hooks/commit-msg, this is needed to send out commit messages. Here's the content:
-----
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to check the commit log message.
# Called by git-commit with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message.  The hook should exit with non-zero
# status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
# commit.  The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# To enable this hook, make this file executable.


# Store the commit message for later mailing out to the list.
cat $1 >> /tmp/bibleditcommits
-----

Then, there's file .git/info/exclude:
-----
# git-ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
