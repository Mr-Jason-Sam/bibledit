The file usfmReference[version].chm.zip was downloaded from the above URL,
unzipped and saved as usfmReference.chm.

On 4 August 2009 Jeff Klassen of the Canadian Bible Society gave
permission to distribute this file: 

"Please feel free to distribute the current version of the CHM help file. 
We're glad that the documentation can be of help."

Since it does not come with a license, it is supposed that the file is
in the public domain.

The .chm file was extracted into its components.

To extract, move the .chm file to the usfm subdirectory of this package,
then unpack it:
extract_chmLib usfmReference.chm .
Then remove the folders that start with $ and the files starting with #.

It produces .htm files and other files.
