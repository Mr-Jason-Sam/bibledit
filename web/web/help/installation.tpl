<h1>{t}Installation{/t}</h1>
<p>{t}If you'd like to install your own version of Bibledit-Web, this is possible too.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}No installable packages have been created yet. But you can clone the source code from the git repository.{/t}</p>
<p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/community/development">{t}See the Development page for more details.{/t}</a></p>
<p>{t}Once you have cloned the source code, and have a local repository for the bibledit code, you can then copy directory web/web into your local web server, and get it up and running there. A web server is needed, PHP, and MySQL. If you have copied the web/web directory to, for example, http://localhost/bibledit, then to install the program and create all the databases, you need to run http://localhost/bibledit/setup.php once.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}To log into the application, use the default username "adminusername" and password "adminpassword". These only work if no Administrator's  account exist on the system. It is recommended, therefore, to open an Administrator's account of your own choice, so that the default values will be disabled.{/t}</p>
