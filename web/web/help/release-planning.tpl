<h1>{t}Release Planning{/t}</h1>
<p>
 {t}The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and delivered during which Sprint.{/t}
 {t}It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning mentions January, February, and so on.{/t}
</p>
<br>
<p>
 {t}It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that everybody can see the grand picture.{/t}
</p>
<br>
<p>{t}The advantages of a release plan are:{/t}</p>
<p>{t}1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and when.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}3. It helps prioritize the actions.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on trade-offs.{/t}</p>
<br>
<p>
 {t}Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback.{/t}
 {t}This assists with the important principle of continual improvement.{/t}
