<h1>{t}Scrum-based Translation{/t}</h1>
<h2>{t}Introduction{/t}</h2>
<p>
 {t}What is Scrum-based translation?{/t}
 {t}A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of translated Scripture.{/t}
 {t}This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is going.{/t}
 {t}It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the facts.{/t}
 {t}Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress.{/t}
 {t}Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time.{/t}
 {t}Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture every iteration, that is, every month.{/t}
 {t}At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback or continue to enhance it.{/t}

 {t}The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics of Scrum-based Translation.{/t}
 {t}It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying to implement it.{/t}
 {t}It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work.{/t}
 {t}If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach.{/t}

<p>{t}* Select the stories the team believes it can commit to in a sprint.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}* Break the stories down into tasks and provide estimates for those tasks.{/t}</p>

<h2>{t}Sprint Backlog{/t}</h2>
<p>{t}* List of tasks that are to be completed in a sprint.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}* The tasks are created by breaking down the stories during the planning meeting.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}* Have estimates in hours or days associated with them.{/t}</p>
