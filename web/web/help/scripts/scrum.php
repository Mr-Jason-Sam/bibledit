<h2><?php echo gettext ("Introduction") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("What is Scrum-based translation?") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of translated Scripture.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is going.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the facts.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture every iteration, that is, every month.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback or continue to enhance it.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics of Scrum-based Translation.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying to implement it.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach.") ?>
</p>
<h2><?php echo gettext ("Product Owner") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("The Product Owner represents the stakeholders.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He understands the requirements for the Bible.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and reliability to the Bible translation.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He knows about accuracy and reliability.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("He defines items that focus on desired features.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or decides to leave them out.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He decides about use or non-use of a dialect.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("He sets the priorities for the work to be done.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("He adds the items to the product backlog.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("Scrum teams should have one Product Owner.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo gettext ("Release Planning") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and delivered during which Sprint.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning mentions January, February, and so on.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that everybody can see the grand picture.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><?php echo gettext ("The advantages of a release planning are:") ?></p>
<p><?php echo gettext ("1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and when.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo gettext ("2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo gettext ("3. It helps prioritize the actions.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo gettext ("4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on trade-offs.") ?></p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This implements the important principle of continual improvement.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <?php echo gettext ("The release planning is a simple way of doing top-down planning.") ?>
  <?php echo gettext ("It is an estimate, simple and quick to do.") ?>
  <?php echo gettext ("It is based on the Product Backlog.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo gettext ("Product Backlog") ?></h2>
<p>
  <?php echo gettext ("The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained for the Bible translation.") ?>
  <?php echo gettext ("It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, comprehension tasks, whatever needs to be done in order to deliver a reliable manuscript.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo gettext ("The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list.") ?>
  <?php echo gettext ("It is used to determine the work for the next sprints.") ?>
  <?php echo gettext ("Each item has an associated estimated time to complete.") ?>
</p>
