 <?php echo gettext ("What is Scrum-based translation?") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of translated Scripture.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is going.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the facts.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture every iteration, that is, every month.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback or continue to enhance it.") ?>
