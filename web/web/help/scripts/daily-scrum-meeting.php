<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("On each day of a sprint, the Bible translation team holds daily meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("These meetings are called: Daily scrum meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The scrum meetings are held in the same place and at the same time.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The daily scrum meeting is best held in the morning, because it assists in setting the context for the work of that day.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("During the meeting, all members stand, as this keeps the discussion short and relevant.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The scrum meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("There is a difference between people who are 'committed' to the Bible translation project, and those who are 'involved' in it.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Scrum affords special status to those who are committed.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("All team members are required to attend the scrum meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The Scrum Master and the and Product Owner (usually the Bible Translation Manager) are committed team members.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("They are expected to attend and participate.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Anyone else, for example a Church leader, a Committee member, or a Translator from another team, is allowed to attend but is there to listen only.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This makes the daily scrum meeting an excellent way for a scrum team to disseminate information.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("If you are interested in hearing the status of the project, attend that day's meeting.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("The scrum meeting is not the place for solving problems or resolving issues.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Issues that are raised are usually dealt with by one or two team members immediately after the scrum.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><?php echo gettext ("During the daily Scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:") ?></p>
<p>1. <?php echo gettext ("What did you do yesterday?") ?></p>
<p>2. <?php echo gettext ("What are you going to do today?") ?></p>
<p>3. <?php echo gettext ("Are there any impediments in your way?") ?></p>
<p><?php echo gettext ("The Scrum Master asks each team member to answer these questions, the member speaks, the Scrum Master thanks the member, and then goes to the next member.") ?></p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("By focusing on what each person did yesterday and will do today, the team gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which the boss is finding out about who is slow in his work.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("If a translator says: Today, I will prepare chapter 10 and 11 of Matthew, everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he did finish.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of these commitments, and that their commitments are to each other, and not to anyone else.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("Any impediments that are raised in the daily scrums become the Scrum Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Typical impediments are:") ?>
</p>
<p>1. <?php echo gettext ("My ... broke and I need a new one today.") ?></p>
<p>2. <?php echo gettext ("I still haven't got the ... I requested a month ago.") ?></p>
<p>3. <?php echo gettext ("I'm struggling to understand ... and would like to discuss it with someone.") ?></p>
<p>4. <?php echo gettext ("The ... has asked me to work on something else for a few days.") ?></p>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("In cases where the Scrum Master cannot remove these impediments directly himself, he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo gettext ("Every day a different person leads the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("This gets the entire team involved.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It opens up new channels for communication.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("It builds trust between the Translators and the Scrum Master.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("Team members can learn from one another's techniques.") ?>
 <?php echo gettext ("The Scrum Master ensures to set a good example for leading the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
