<h1>{t}Typesetting Bibles{/t}</h1>
<h2>{t}Introduction{/t}</h2>
<p>{t}The Bible has been translated. It is time to publish it.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}This article gives some hints about how to typeset a Bible.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}At the end of all, you will have a PDF file with the whole Bible, typeset, ready for publishing.{/t}</p>
<h2>{t}Basic assumptions{/t}</h2>
<p>{t}The Bible is available in USFM code. The USFM code is clean and adheres to the standards.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}You have access to your own copy of Bibledit-Web, or to the Bibledit-Web demo on the internet.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}You have access to a copy of LibreOffice or OpenOffice.{/t}</p>
<h2>{t}Creating the OpenDocument files{/t}</h2>
<p>{t}This section writes about a specific Bible that was to be prepared for publication. It gives the steps I took to convert the USFM code to OpenDocument files.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}The OpenDocument files are used as a starting point for typesetting. Typesetting itself is done in LibreOffice.{/t}</p>
<br>
<p>{t}The Bible is available in USFM files. Each Bible book is stored as one USFM file.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Create a new Bible in Bibledit-Web through menu Management / Bibles. Give the Bible a name. I call it "Ndebele".{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Click the "Ndebele" Bible.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Import data into it.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Choose the option to upload a file.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}You can upload 66 separate files, or you can put all the 66 files into one zipped file, and then upload that zipped file. I chose the second option, as being easier and quicker than the first. Importing took about a minute. The logbook shows the progress.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Create a new stylesheet in menu Management / Styles. Give it a name. I call it "Ndebele".{/t}</p>
<p>{t}All the data is now in Bibledit-Web. Everthing is ready for export to OpenDocument files.{/t}</p>
<br>
<p>{t}Let us now make the first export and see how the files look.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Go to menu Management / Exports.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Add Bible "Ndebele" to the ones that will be exported.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Use stylesheet "Ndebele".{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Output the chapter number in drop caps. Switch that setting on.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Set the page size. I've used a width of 138 mm and a height of 210 mm.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Set the margins. I've used 10 mm for all four margins.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Do not display the date in the running headers. Switch that setting off.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Do a fresh export. Give it some time to complete the exports.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}Go to menu Members / Downloads / Exported Bibles, and choose your Bible there. Then go to OpenDocument.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}You will see the Bible exported into several format.{/t}</p>
<p>{t}View them and see if you like them.{/t}</p>
