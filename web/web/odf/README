The template.odf was created in LibreOffice, as an empty document, and then saved as OpenDocument.

Two folders were removed from this template:
Configuration2
Thumbnails

The software that uses this template assumes a style name "Mpm1" for the style:page-layout element,
such as LibreOffice creates by default.
The software uses this style:page-layout element to set page size and margins.
It assumes that there is only one style:page-layout element.
