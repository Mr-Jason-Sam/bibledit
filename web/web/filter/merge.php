  /*
  This filter merges files.
  There are four arguments, all representing filenames:
  $base: Filename with the merge base.
  $user: Filename with the modifications made by the user.
  $server: Filename with the modifications coming from the collaboration server.
  $output: Fileame for the merged output.
  The filter uses program "merge" do do a three-way merge.
  It converts the data into a new format with one character per line, 
  for better merging and far fewer conflicts.
  In case of a conflict, it favours the modification from the server.
