The PHP scripts import data from the database of GBS Digitaal 2.9,
and stores it in USFM.

Condition is that the database is copied from GBS Digitaal to your own
mysql server on Linux. And that there is a working Bibledit-Web.

To copy the GBS database, do the following:

- Install GBS Digitaal on Windows.

- Read the license. What we are going to do here is not forbidden
  by the license.

- Copy folder C:\Program Files\2G\GBS Digitaal\mysql\data\gbs
  and whatever it contains from Windows to Linux.
  Put it in /var/lib/mysql.
  The above has been tested on Ubuntu 11.04.

The mysql server on Linux now has an added database.
The database is called 'gbs'.
The database is accessible as usual.
All texts of GBS are in this database.
Through phpMyAdmin these text can be viewed easily.

There are several scripts.
All of these run in a terminal: $ php script.php

datheen.php reads the 'Psalmen van Datheen', converts the data to USFM, 
and stores it in Bibledit-Web as a Bible called 'Psalmen van Datheen'.

bijbel.php reads the Statenbijbel, converts the data to USFM,
and stores it in Bibledit-Wewb as a Bible called 'Statenbijbel'.
The data needs to be polished up, e.g. searching for '<' yields
some places that can do with a facelift.
