msgid ""
"1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to "

"media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called \"repository\" "
"is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice the \"sudo\" command, which means that this usually needs to be done "
"by user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be "

msgid ""
"Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be "
"made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the \"sudo\" again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by "
"trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is "
"writable. Here's the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be "
"removed again:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. "

msgstr ""

msgid "3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's "
"user. To do this, type the following two commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All steps have now been taken. Before removing the flash drive, ensure that "
"the data gets written to it, by issuing the command:"

msgid "The Notes are an important part of Consultations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The notes help to record the discussions with consultants and other people."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, when going to the Consultation Notes, you will see a list of "
"notes. It would say, for example, \"Displaying notes 1 - 5 / 5\". This means "
"that it would display notes 1 to 5, out of 5 notes total."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can edit the display. That means that you can edit the number of notes "
"that will display in that list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Clicking \"edit\" takes you to a new page, called Edit Notes Display. This "
"enables you to \"edit\" how the notes will be displayed, and how many."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first thing that you can edit is how many notes will be selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to any passage, then notes will be selected "
"that refer to any passage, from Genesis to Revelation. But when you select "
"notes that refer to the current verse, then only those notes will be "
"selected that refer to the currently opened verse. In case you have Genesis "
"2.2 open in the navigator, then only notes that refer to that particular "
"verse are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that have been edited at any time, then all notes would "
"be selected. But when you select notes that have been edited on \"today\", "
"then only today's notes are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The note selection mechanism combines all selection methods that have been "
"set. If you select notes that refer to the current verse, for example, and "
"that have been edited today, and only those notes that both refer to the "
"current verse, and that also have been edited today, are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are other notes selection mechanisms as well. See the relevant page "
"for all selection mechanisms. Things should be plain and there should be no "
"need for any further information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One thing that would need explanation would be the mechanism that selects "
"notes that contain certain text. This is intended to be used to search notes "
"for text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that contain \"any\" text, then searching for text in "
"the note is not done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Searching for text can be done by selecting notes that contain specific "
"words or text. When you select this option, you will see that an entry "
"becomes visible. Search text should be entered there. Then the Save button "
"should be pressed. This is to save that search text. Or just pressing Enter "
"while the cursor is in that entry will do also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you search for, for example, \"house\" (without the quotes), then notes "
"that contain the word \"house\" will be selected. Notes that contain the "
"word \"houses\", notice the plural, would not be selected. To select this "
"plural form, you can use wildcards. Instead of entering \"house\", enter "
"\"house*\". Notice the asterisk. This will select notes that contains the "
"word \"house\" or \"houses\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also enter two or more words to search for. The search routine will "
"then do its best to select these notes that contain some or all of these "
"words. Notes that contain all words are given first, and notes that contains "
"only one or a few of the words will be given later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to the current verse, and then also search "
"for some text, then only the notes that refer to the current verse would be "
"searched. It is important to be aware of this. At times one may search for "
"words or phrases, and get zero results, yet he is sure that there should be "
"some results. This would happen because the user does not search the whole "
"Bible, but only the current verse. The same applies to other selection "
"mechanisms. Therefore, when searching notes for text, you may want to set "
"all other selection mechanisms to \"any\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is more that can be said about searching notes. The wildcard operator "
"already has been mentioned. Here is a list of possible operators:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, when no opeerator specified, the word is optional, but the "
"result that contain it will be rated higher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in every result "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any "
"result returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution "
"to the result relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking noise words. "
"A result that contains such a word will be rated lower than others, but will "
"not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the minus operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "
"appended to the word, or fragment, not prepended. This means that if there "
"is a note with the word \"house\", and you search for \"*ouse\", this note "
"won't be selected. Yes, this is unusual, but this is how the database search "
"works. To minimize the pain of this, measures have been taken that if you "
"type any part of the word, the expected result will still be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double quotes at the beginning and end of a phrase, gives only the notes "
"that contain the complete phrase, as it was typed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each note can be assigned to somebody. The person to whom the note is "
"assigned then knows that action should be taken on this note. Or the person "
"can be automatically emailed if the note gets changed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit-Web"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit is a web-based application for translating the Bible. It is part of "
"the Bibledit suite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea behind Bibledit-Web is that various users can log into the "
"application, and that each user has a certain \"level\" within the "
"application. This level will give him or her more or less rights."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's the most basic level, which is \"Visitor\". A visitor can be anybody "
"who visit the site. Visitors should be able to see the Bibles being "
"translated on the site."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next level is a \"Member\". A member is somebody who has signed up to "
"the site, and has confirmed this signup through his email. This is an "
"independent process, which means whoever wants can become a \"Member\". "
"Members will be able to do the same as Visitors, but in addition they will "
"be able to raise Issues or \"Consultation Notes\" on the site. These notes "
"presumably will be about how a certain passage has been translated. Members "
"should be able to subscribe to changes in the Bible, and to changes in "
"Consultation Notes, so that they are notified by email about this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, again the next level, there can be a \"Consultant\". Consultants are "
"people who can be consulted because of their knowledge of the original "
"language such as Hebrew or Greek, or because of their knowledge of their "
"target language in case they are language scholars, or for any other "
"knowledge they have. Nobody can become a Consultant by himself, this level "
"is assigned to him by the Manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next level is \"Translator\". These are the ones that have all the "
"rights of the Consultant, but in addition can actually change the Bible text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then there's the \"Manager\". The manager has all the privileges of the "
"previous levels, but in addition can add books to the Bible, delete books, "
"add chapters, copy Bibles, and so on. The manager can assign privileges to "
"the translators, consultants, and so on."
msgstr ""

"do anything, and will do the technical setup and maintenance of the site."
