"MySQL. If you have copied the web/web directory to, for example, http://"
"localhost/bibledit, then to install the program and create all the "
"databases, you need to run http://localhost/bibledit/setup.php once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To log into the application, use the default username \"adminusername\" and "

"Bibledit is a web-based application for translating the Bible. It is part of "

msgid ""
"The next level is a \"Member\". A member is somebody who has signed up to "
"the site, and has confirmed this signup through his email. This is an "
"independent process, which means whoever wants can become a \"Member\". "
"Members will be able to do the same as Visitors, but in addition they will "
"be able to raise Issues or \"Consultation Notes\" on the site. These notes "
"presumably will be about how a certain passage has been translated. Members "
"should be able to subscribe to changes in the Bible, and to changes in "
"Consultation Notes, so that they are notified by email about this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, again the next level, there can be a \"Consultant\". Consultants are "
"people who can be consulted because of their knowledge of the original "
"language such as Hebrew or Greek, or because of their knowledge of their "
"target language in case they are language scholars, or for any other "
"knowledge they have. Nobody can become a Consultant by himself, this level "
"is assigned to him by the Manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next level is \"Translator\". These are the ones that have all the "
"rights of the Consultant, but in addition can actually change the Bible text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then there's the \"Manager\". The manager has all the privileges of the "
"previous levels, but in addition can add books to the Bible, delete books, "
"add chapters, copy Bibles, and so on. The manager can assign privileges to "
"the translators, consultants, and so on."

msgstr ""

msgid "Open a terminal. In the terminal, give the command:"

msgid "The output of this command can be something like:"

"Looking through the list of mounting points, we assume that the USB flash "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before the stick can be formatted, it must be unmounted first. Issue the "

msgid ""
"After the label has been written to it, remove the USB flash drive from the "

"To make this flash drive fit for collaboration, there are a few steps to be "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to "
"make that directory writable. If we assume that the flash drive mounts at /"
"media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called \"repository\" "
"is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice the \"sudo\" command, which means that this usually needs to be done "
"by user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be "
"denied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be "
"made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the \"sudo\" again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by "
"trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is "
"writable. Here's the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be "
"removed again:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. "
"Type:"
msgstr ""

msgid "3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's "
"user. To do this, type the following two commands:"
msgstr ""
