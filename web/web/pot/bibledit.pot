"The following needs consideration if the Bible includes more than one book. "
"Does the next book follow on the same page on which the previous book "
"finished, or do the books follow on from one another in a different way? "
"Whatever method is chosen, it needs to be applied consistently throughout "
"the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Line spacing should be consistent throughout and should be placed line on "
"line across all pages. It means that they should all line up with each other "
"all the way down the page and across all pages. Then when the Bible is "
"printed, the printed text will be back to back and not show through from one "
"side of the page to the other. In the typesetting software, this can be "
"implemented by setting up a grid in the document, and then aligning all text "
"to this grid."
msgstr ""

#, c-format
msgid ""
"The space after the verse numbers would be the same and consistent. Bibledit-"
"Web exports the text to OpenDocument format using 'en spaces' after each "
"verse. This ensures a consistent width of the spaces after the verse "
"numbers. Superscript numerals could also be considered, though larger than "
"any note citations in the text. The size of the superscript would be between "
"70 and 80% of the size of the main text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The alignment of the drop caps chapter numbers to the text beside it is to "
"be consistent. There should be some space between the numbers and the text. "
"Drop cap characters should not be too large and not rise too far above the "
"height of the other letters on the first line. The top of the highest "
"letters should reach to about the same height. The drop cap characters in "
"the body of the text should not be indented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The chapter divisions would also benefit from some more space between them "
"and the text of the preceding chapter. When there is no heading above a "
"chapter, it may be visually better to start the chapter number with a line "
"space before it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The amount of space given to the Bible book headings should not be too great."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings should not appear squashed amongst the rest of the text and "
"would benefit from some space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings are an addition and not Scripture, so it is appropriate to put "
"these in italics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The space between the text and footnotes should not be too tight neither "
"unnecessarily large. Keep the gap between the references in the footer and "
"the main bock of text as consistent as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The footnotes and crossreferences should not have a large variation in how "
"far they finish from the foot of the page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the crossreferences it is pleasing to have the chapter and verse number "
"kept together with the book name, especially as the small font on long lines "

"ends."

msgid "The gap between the columns should be between 4 and 5 mm."

"The centre line dividing the two columns should start about level or very "
"slightly above the top of the highest ascenders on the first line of text in "

"For singable Psalms, readability would be helped by distinguishing the verse "
"numbers visually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is helpful to distinguish the running head, perhaps by using a semi-bold "
"version of the same font."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way in which the number of pages in a volume could be reduced without "
"loss of readability would be to choose a font with slightly shorter "
"ascenders and descenders and then tighten the leading (line spacing) "
"slightly."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last line of a verse or paragraph should not appear on its own at the "
"top of a column. The typesetting software will have a setting for 'orphans' "
"to control this. An elegant way of avoiding orphans is to increase or "
"decrease the tracking of the text. This is the overall spacing of the "
"letters in a paragraph or on a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid hyphenations in the headings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many book titles consist of a main title and a subtitle, like \"The gospel "

"It is good if there is a clear contrast on size between these two. Say 24 "
"points bold for the main title, and 14 points regular for the subtitle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of hyphens used in a row should be few for enhanced readability. "
"The number of hyphens used in a row should not amount to more than three "
"consecutive hyphenated lines. At times a word that is now hyphenated could "
"be forced down onto the next line without opening up the gaps between the "
"words too much on the line above. Hyphenation should be set to the optimum "
"result for the column width but then it is usually necessary to go over "
"every page and make corrections manually."

"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any "

"A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution "

"A result that contains such a word will be rated lower than others, but will "
"not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the minus operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "
"appended to the word, or fragment, not prepended. This means that if there "
"is a note with the word \"house\", and you search for \"*ouse\", this note "
"won't be selected. Yes, this is unusual, but this is how the database search "
"works. To minimize the pain of this, measures have been taken that if you "
"type any part of the word, the expected result will still be found."
msgstr ""

"Double quotes at the beginning and end of a phrase, gives only the notes "
"that contain the complete phrase, as it was typed."

msgid ""
"1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to "

"media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called \"repository\" "
"is:"
msgstr ""

"made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the \"sudo\" again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by "
"trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is "
"writable. Here's the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be "
"removed again:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. "

msgid "To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:"
msgstr ""

"4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's "

msgstr ""
