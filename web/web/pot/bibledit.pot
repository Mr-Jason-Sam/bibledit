msgid "Scrum-based Translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Scrum-based translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of "
"translated Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is "
"going."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the "
"facts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others "
"with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to "
"deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture "
"every iteration, that is, every month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and "
"decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback "
"or continue to enhance it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics "
"of Scrum-based Translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying "
"to implement it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some "
"reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Creates and prioritizes the product backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Understands the requirements for the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Knows about accuracy and reliability."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* Used to estimate when certain Bible books will be translated, tested, or "
"released."
msgstr ""

msgid "* It's a simple way of doing top-down planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "* It is an estimate, simple and quick to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "* It is based on the Product Backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid "* Used to determine the work for the next sprints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* A prioritized list of everything needed or wanted for the desired "
"translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Often written in the form of user stories."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Have estimates associated with them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint"
msgstr ""

msgid "* Iteration typically of one month's length."
msgstr ""

"* This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) "
"occurs."

msgid "Daily Scrum Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* Team members share progress with other team members (not the manager)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* Team members answer three questions – “what did you do yesterday”, “what "
"will you do today”, “do you have any roadblocks”."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Anyone may attend, only team members may speak."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* Scrum master uses the information from the meeting to update burndown "
"chart illustrating progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* Fifteen minutes maximum - typically held standing up in front of Task "
"Board - helps keep the meeting focused."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Side conversations are taken offline."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* The Product Owner looks through the sprint’s work and provides feedback."

"* Team owns up to deficiencies with the translation, helping to build trust "
"with the Product Owner."

msgstr ""

msgid "* Team reviews what went well and what went poorly."

msgid "* Use retrospection techniques to find potential for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "* Pick one or two areas to focus for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sprint typically takes one month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without "
"consulting others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his "
"colleagues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no "
"mistakes occur."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reviews are done every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It speeds up the translation procedure because there's more actual "
"translation work going on, and less discussions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newer members of the team learn from the more experienced ones through "
"the daily reviews."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit-Web has the concept of daily Change Notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid "A member can opt to receive the Change Notifications through email."
msgstr ""

msgid "This email can be viewed online also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or a member can opt to have the Change Notifications generated for him "
"online, and can review and approve them there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Methodology"
msgstr ""

msgid "The translation process is scrum-based."
msgstr ""

msgid "The discussions are transparent, fair, and argued."
