<h1>Sword</h1>
<p>Folder "basic-1" contains a Sword module generated from OSIS generated from basic USFM through the Python usfm2osis.py script.</p>
<p>Folder "basic-2" is the same as above, but using the Perl usfm2osis.pl script.</p>
<p>Folder "full-1" contains a Sword module generated from OSIS generated from full USFM through the Python usfm2osis.py script.</p>
<p>Folder "full-2" is the same as above, but using the Perl usfm2osis.pl script.</p>
<p>Each folder contains a zipped Sword module. This Sword module can be downloaded, and then be installed in the Sword Bible program.</p>
<p>The Sword utilities are maintained by the <a href="http://www.crosswire.org">CrossWire Bible Society</a>.</p>
<p>If the administrator has set up Sword module repositories, then the following four remote sources will be available:</p>
