\s1 The last of the terrible troubles
\p
\v 1 After this, I looked at the sky and saw something else that was strange and important. Seven angels were bringing the last seven terrible troubles. When these are ended, God will no longer be angry.
\p
\v 2 Then I saw something that looked like a glass sea mixed with fire, and people were standing on it. They were the ones who had defeated the beast and the idol and the number that tells the name of the beast. God had given them harps,
\v 3 and they were singing the song that his servant Moses and the Lamb had sung. They were singing,\x - \xo 15.3: \xt Ex 15.1.\x*
\q1 “Lord God All-Powerful,
\q1 you have done great
\q2 and marvellous things.
\q1 You are the ruler
\q2 of all nations,
\q1 and you do what is
\q2 right and fair.
\q1
\v 4 Lord, who doesn't honour\x - \xo 15.4: a \xt Jr 10.7; \xo b \xt Ps 86.9.\x*
\q2 and praise your name?
\q1 You alone are holy,
\q1 and all nations will come
\q2 and worship you,
\q1 because you have shown
\q1 that you judge
\q2 with fairness.”
\p
\v 5 After this, I noticed something else in heaven. The sacred tent used for a temple was open.\x - \xo 15.5: \xt Ex 38.21.\x*
\v 6 And the seven angels who were bringing the terrible troubles were coming out of it. They were dressed in robes of pure white linen and wore belts made of pure gold.
\v 7 One of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a bowl made of gold. These bowls were filled with the anger of God who lives for ever and ever.
\v 8 The temple quickly filled with smoke from the glory and power of God. No one could enter it until the seven angels had finished pouring out the seven last troubles.\x - \xo 15.8: \xt Ex 40.34; 1 K 8.10,11; 2 Ch 5.13,14; Is 6.4.\x*
