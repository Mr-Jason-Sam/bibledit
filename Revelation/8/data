\ms1 Seven trumpets
\s1 The seventh seal is opened
\p
\v 1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
\v 2 I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet.
\p
\v 3 Another angel, who had a gold container for incense,\f + \fr 8.3 \fq incense: \ft See the note at 5.8.\f* came and stood at the altar. This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God's people on the gold altar in front of the throne.\x - \xo 8.3: a \xt Am 9.1; \xo b \xt Ex 30.1,3.\x*
\v 4 Then the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up to God from the hand of the angel.
\p
\v 5 After this, the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth. Thunder roared, lightning flashed, and the earth shook.\x - \xo 8.5: a \xt Lv 16.12; Ez 10.2; \xo b \xt Ex 19.16; Rev 11.19; 16.18.\x*
\s1 The trumpets
\p
\v 6 The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets.
\p
\v 7 When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. A third of the earth, a third of the trees, and a third of all green plants were burnt.\x - \xo 8.7: \xt Ex 9.23-25; Ez 38.22.\x*
\p
\v 8 When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,
\v 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 When the third angel blew his trumpet, a great star fell from heaven. It was burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water.\x - \xo 8.10: \xt Is 14.12.\x*
\v 11 The name of the star was Bitter, and a third of the water turned bitter. Many people died because the water was so bitter.\x - \xo 8.11: \xt Jr 9.15.\x*
\p
\v 12 When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. They each lost a third of their light. So during a third of the day there was no light, and a third of the night was also without light.\x - \xo 8.12: \xt Is 13.10; Ez 32.7; Jl 2.10,31; 3.15.\x*
\p
\v 13 Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky. It was shouting, “Trouble, trouble, trouble to everyone who lives on earth! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets.”
