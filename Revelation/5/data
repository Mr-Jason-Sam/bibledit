\ms1 A scroll with seven seals
\s1 The scroll and the Lamb
\p
\v 1 In the right hand of the one sitting on the throne I saw a scroll\f + \fr 5.1 \fq scroll: \ft A roll of paper or special leather used for writing on. Sometimes a scroll would be sealed on the outside with one or more pieces of wax.\f* that had writing on the inside and on the outside. And it was sealed in seven places.\x - \xo 5.1: \xt Ez 2.9,10; Is 29.11.\x*
\v 2 I saw a mighty angel ask with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
\v 3 No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or see inside it.
\p
\v 4 I cried hard because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or see inside it.
\v 5 Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop crying and look! The one who is called both the ‘Lion from the Tribe of Judah’\f + \fr 5.5 \fq ‘Lion from the Tribe of Judah’: \ft In Genesis 49.9 the tribe of Judah is called a young lion, and King David was from Judah.\f* and ‘King David's Great Descendant’\f + \fr 5.5 \fq ‘King David's Great Descendant’: \ft The Greek text has “the root of David” which is a title for the Messiah based on Isaiah 11.1,10.\f* has won the victory. He will open the book and its seven seals.”\x - \xo 5.5: a \xt Gn 49.9; \xo b \xt Is 11.1,10.\x*
\p
\v 6 Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the centre of the throne that was surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits\fe * \fq the seven spirits: \ft Some manuscripts have “the spirits”.\fe* of God, sent out to all the earth.\x - \xo 5.6: a \xt Is 53.7; \xo b \xt Zec 4.10.\x*
\p
\v 7 The Lamb went over and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne.
\v 8 After he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders knelt down before him. Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense,\f + \fr 5.8 \fq incense: \ft A material that produces a sweet smell when burnt. Sometimes it is a symbol for the prayers of God's people.\f* which are the prayers of God's people.\x - \xo 5.8: \xt Ps 141.2.\x*
\v 9 Then they sang a new song,\x - \xo 5.9: \xt Ps 33.3; 98.1; Is 42.10.\x*
\q1 “You are worthy
\q2 to receive the scroll
\q1 and open its seals,
\q2 because you were killed.
\q1 And with your own blood
\q2 you bought for God
\q1 people from every tribe,
\q2 language, nation, and race.
\q1
\v 10 You let them become kings\x - \xo 5.10: \xt Ex 19.6; Rev 1.6.\x*
\q2 and serve God as priests,
\q1 and they will rule on earth.”
\p
\v 11 As I looked, I heard the voices of a lot of angels around the throne and the voices of the living creatures and of the elders. There were millions and millions of them,\x - \xo 5.11: \xt Dn 7.10.\x*
\v 12 and they were saying in a loud voice,
\q1 “The Lamb who was killed
\q2 is worthy to receive power,
\q1 riches, wisdom, strength,
\q2 honour, glory, and praise.”
\p
\v 13 Then I heard all beings in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea offer praise. Together, all of them were saying,
\q1 “Praise, honour, glory,
\q1 and strength
\q2 for ever and ever
\q1 to the one who sits
\q1 on the throne
\q2 and to the Lamb!”
\p
\v 14 The four living creatures said “Amen”, while the elders knelt down and worshipped.
