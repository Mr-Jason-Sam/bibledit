King James Bible

How to create it:

If the SWORD api is installed on Linux, install the KJV Bible.
Then, give the following command:

mod2osis KJV > swordkjv.xml

This produces the file. 

It is important for Bibledit that this name is kept. 
It looks for it on startup, and creates a database out of it.
