Source Language King James Bible

We use two sources and create a combination that combines the best elements of the two.

Source: SWORD library

How to create it:

If the SWORD api is installed on Linux, install the KJV Bible.
Then, give the following command:

mod2osis KJV > swordkjv.xml

This produces the file. 


Source: Zefania XML Bible Markup Language
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/
KJV+ Strongs

Download the files, and unpack it to sf_kjv_strongs_rev1b.xm,
then rename this to zefaniakjv.xml.


It is important for Bibledit that both these names are used. 
It looks for it on startup, and creates a database out of it.
