\s1 The tower of Babel
\p
\v 1 At first everyone spoke the same language,
\v 2 but after some of them moved from the east\fe * \fq from the east: \ft Or “to the east”.\fe* and settled in Babylonia,\fe * \fq Babylonia: \ft See the note at 10.6-20.\fe*
\v 3-4 they said:
\pi Let's build a city with a tower that reaches to the sky! We'll use hard bricks and tar instead of stone and mortar. We'll become famous, and we won't be scattered all over the world.
\p
\v 5 But when the \nd Lord\nd* came down to look at the city and the tower,
\v 6 he said:
\pi These people are working together because they all speak the same language. This is just the beginning. Soon they will be able to do anything they want.
\v 7 Come on! Let's go down and confuse them by making them speak different languages—then they won't be able to understand each other.
\p
\v 8-9 So the people had to stop building the city, because the \nd Lord\nd* confused their language and scattered them all over the earth. That's how the city of Babel\f + \fr 11.8,9 \fq Babel: \ft In Hebrew “Babel” sounds like “confused”.\f* got its name.

Terah's sons were born in the city of Ur in Chaldea,\f + \fr 11.26-28 \fq Ur in Chaldea: \ft Chaldea was a region at the head of the Persian Gulf. Ur was on the main trade routes from Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean Sea.\f* and Haran died there before the death of his father. The following is the story of Terah's descendants.
\p
\v 29-30 Abram married Sarai, but she was not able to have any children. And Nahor married Milcah, who was the daughter of Haran and the sister of Iscah.
\p
