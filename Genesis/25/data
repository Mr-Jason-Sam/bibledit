\s1 The death of Abraham
\p

\ms1 Isaac and his family
\s1 The birth of Esau and Jacob
\p
\v 19 Isaac was the son of Abraham,
\v 20 and he was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel. She was also the sister of Laban, the Aramean from northern Syria.\fe * \fr 25.20 \fq northern Syria: \ft See the note at 24.10.\fe*
\p Almost twenty years later,
\v 21 Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac asked the \nd Lord\nd* to let her have a child, and the \nd Lord\nd* answered his prayer.
\p
\v 22 Before Rebekah gave birth, she knew she was going to have twins, because she could feel them inside her, fighting each other. She thought, “Why is this happening to me?” Finally, she asked the \nd Lord\nd* why her twins were fighting,
\v 23 and he told her:\x - \xo 25.23: \xt Ro 9.12.\x*
\b
\q1 “Your two sons will become
\q2 two separate nations.\fe * \fr 25.23 \fq two separate nations: \ft Or “two nations always in conflict”.\fe*
\q1 The younger of the two
\q2 will be stronger,
\q1 and the elder son
\q2 will be his servant.”
\b
\p
\v 24 When Rebekah gave birth,
\v 25 the first baby was covered with red hair, so he was named Esau.\f + \fr 25.25 \fq Esau: \ft In Hebrew “Esau” sounds like “hairy”.\f*
\v 26 The second baby grabbed his brother's heel, so they named him Jacob.\f + \fr 25.26 \fq Jacob: \ft In Hebrew “Jacob” sounds like “heel”.\f* Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
\s1 Esau sells his rights as the firstborn son
\p
\v 27 As Jacob and Esau grew older, Esau liked the outdoors and became a good hunter, while Jacob settled down and became a shepherd.
\v 28 Esau would take the meat of wild animals to his father Isaac, and so Isaac loved him more, but Jacob was his mother's favourite son.
\p
\v 29 One day, Jacob was cooking some stew, when Esau came home hungry
\v 30 and said, “I'm starving to death! Give me some of that red stew at once!” That's how Esau got the name “Edom”.\f + \fr 25.30 \fq Edom: \ft In Hebrew “Edom” sounds like “red”.\f*
\p
\v 31 Jacob replied, “Sell me your rights as the firstborn son.”\f + \fr 25.31 \fq rights...son: \ft The firstborn son inherited the largest amount of property, as well as the leadership of the family.\f*
\p
\v 32 “I'm about to die,” Esau answered. “What good will those rights do me?”
\p
\v 33 But Jacob said, “Promise me your birthrights, here and now!” And that's what Esau did.\x - \xo 25.33: \xt He 12.16.\x*
\v 34 Jacob then gave Esau some bread and some of the bean stew, and when Esau had finished eating and drinking, he just got up and left, showing how little he thought of his rights as the firstborn.
