\ms1 Joseph in Egypt
\s1 Joseph and Potiphar's wife
\p
\v 1 The Ishmaelites took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, the king's\fe * \fq the king's: \ft See the note at 12.15.\fe* official in charge of the palace guard.
\v 2-3 So Joseph lived in the home of Potiphar, his Egyptian owner.\x - \xo 39.2: \xt Ac 7.9.\x*
\p Soon Potiphar realized that the \nd Lord\nd* was helping Joseph to be successful in whatever he did.
\v 4 Potiphar liked Joseph and made him his personal assistant, putting him in charge of his house and all his property.
\v 5 Because of Joseph, the \nd Lord\nd* began to bless Potiphar's family and fields.
\v 6 Potiphar left everything up to Joseph, and with Joseph there, the only decision he had to make was what he wanted to eat.
\p Joseph was well-built and handsome,
\v 7 and Potiphar's wife soon noticed him. She asked him to make love to her,
\v 8 but he refused and said, “My master isn't worried about anything in his house, because he has placed me in charge of everything he owns.
\v 9 No one in my master's house is more important than I am. The only thing he hasn't given me is you, and that's because you are his wife. I won't sin against God by doing such a terrible thing as this.”
\v 10 She kept begging Joseph day after day, but he refused to do what she wanted or even to go near her.
\p
\v 11 One day, Joseph went to Potiphar's house to do his work, and none of the other servants were there.
\v 12 Potiphar's wife grabbed hold of his coat and said, “Make love to me!” Joseph ran out of the house, leaving her hanging on to his coat.
\p
\v 13 When this happened,
\v 14 she called in her servants and said, “Look! This Hebrew has come just to make fools of us. He tried to rape me, but I screamed for help.
\v 15 And when he heard me scream, he ran out of the house, leaving his coat with me.”
\p
\v 16 Potiphar's wife kept Joseph's coat until her husband came home.
\v 17 Then she said, “That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me!
\v 18 But when I screamed for help, he left his coat and ran out of the house.”
\p
\v 19 Potiphar became very angry
\v 20 and threw Joseph in the same prison where the king's prisoners were kept.
\p While Joseph was in prison,
\v 21 the \nd Lord\nd* helped him and was good to him. He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that\x - \xo 39.21: \xt Ac 7.9.\x*
\v 22 he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail.
\v 23 The jailer did not worry about anything, because the \nd Lord\nd* was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did.
