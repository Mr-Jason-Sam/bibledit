\c 45
\s1 Joseph tells his brothers who he is
\p
\v 1 Since Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants, he sent them out of the room. When he was alone with his brothers, he told them, “I am Joseph.”\x - \xo 45.1: \xt Ac 7.13.\x*
\v 2 Then he cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and told about it in the king's\fe * \fr 45.2 \fq the king's: \ft See the note at 12.15.\fe* palace.
\p
\v 3 Joseph asked his brothers if his father was still alive, but they were too frightened to answer.
\v 4 Joseph told them to come closer to him, and when they did, he said:
\pi Yes, I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt.
\v 5 Don't worry or blame yourselves for what you did. God is the one who sent me ahead of you to save lives.
\pi
\v 6 There has already been a famine for two years, and for five more years no one will plough fields or harvest grain.
\v 7 But God sent me on ahead of you to keep your families alive and to save you in this wonderful way.
\v 8 After all, you weren't really the ones who sent me here—it was God. He made me the highest official in the king's court and placed me over all Egypt.
\pi
\v 9 Now hurry back and tell my father that his son Joseph says, “God has made me ruler of Egypt. Come here as quickly as you can.\x - \xo 45.9-11: \xt Ac 7.14.\x*
\v 10 You will live near me in the region of Goshen with your children and grandchildren, as well as with your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own.
\v 11 I will take care of you there during the next five years of famine. But if you don't come, you and your family and your animals will starve to death.”
\pi
\v 12 All of you, including my brother Benjamin, can tell by what I have said that I really am Joseph.
\v 13 Tell my father about my great power here in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him here.
\p
\v 14 Joseph and Benjamin hugged each other and started crying.
\v 15 Joseph was still crying as he kissed each of his other brothers. After this, they started talking with Joseph.
\p
\v 16 When it was told in the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were happy.
\v 17 So the king said to Joseph:
\pi Tell your brothers to load their donkeys and return to Canaan.
\v 18 They must bring their father and their families here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they can eat and enjoy everything that grows on it.
\v 19 Also tell your brothers to take some wagons from Egypt for their wives and children to ride in. And they must be sure to bring their father.
\v 20 They can leave their possessions behind, because they will be given the best of everything in Egypt.
\p
\v 21 Jacob's sons agreed to do what the king had said. And Joseph gave them wagons and food for their trip home, just as the king had ordered.
\v 22 Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers, but to Benjamin he gave five new outfits and three hundred pieces of silver.
\v 23 To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt, and ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip.
\v 24 Then he sent his brothers off and told them, “Don't argue on the way home!”
\p
\v 25 Joseph's brothers left Egypt, and when they arrived in Canaan,
\v 26 they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them.
\v 27 Then they told him everything Joseph had said. When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, he felt much better
\v 28 and said, “Now I can believe you! My son Joseph must really be alive, and I will get to see him before I die.”
