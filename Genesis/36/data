\ms1 Esau and his family
\p
\v 1 Esau, also known as Edom, had many descendants.
\v 2 He married three Canaanite women: the first was Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; the second was Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;\x - \xo 36.2: \xt Gn 26.34.\x*
\v 3 the third was Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebaioth's sister.\x - \xo 36.3: \xt Gn 28.9.\x*
\p
\v 4-5 Esau and his three wives had five sons while in Canaan. Adah's son was Eliphaz; Basemath's son was Reuel; Oholibamah's three sons were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
\p
\v 6 Esau took his children and wives, his relatives and servants, his animals and possessions he had got while in Canaan, and moved far from Jacob.
\v 7 He did this because the land was too crowded and could not support him and his brother with their flocks and herds.
\v 8 That's why Esau made his home in the hill country of Seir.
\p
\v 9-14 Esau lived in the hill country of Seir and was the ancestor of the Edomites. Esau had three wives: Adah, Basemath, and Oholibamah. Here is a list of his descendants: Esau and Adah had a son named Eliphaz, whose sons were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. Timna was the other wife\f + \fr 36.9-14 \fq other wife: \ft See the note at 22.24.\f* of Esau's son Eliphaz, and she had a son named Amalek.
\p Esau and Basemath had a son named Reuel, whose sons were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
\p Esau and Oholibamah had three sons: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
