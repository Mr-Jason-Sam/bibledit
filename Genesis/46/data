\ms1 Jacob and his family go to Egypt
\p
\v 1 Jacob packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshipped.
\v 2 That night, God spoke to him and said, “Jacob! Jacob!”
\p “Here I am,” Jacob answered.
\p
\v 3 God said, “I am God, the same God your father worshipped. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation.
\v 4 I will go with you to Egypt, and later I will bring your descendants back here. Your son Joseph will be at your side when you die.”
\p
\v 5-7 Jacob and his family set out from Beersheba and headed for Egypt. His sons put him in the wagon that the king\fe * \fr 46.5-7 \fq the king: \ft See the note at 12.15.\fe* had sent for him, and they put their small children and their wives in the other wagons. Jacob's whole family went to Egypt, including his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters.

\p
\v 28 Jacob had sent his son Judah ahead of him to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen.
\v 29 So Joseph got in his chariot and went to meet his father. When they met, Joseph hugged his father around the neck and cried for a long time.
\v 30 Jacob said to Joseph, “Now that I have seen you and know you are still alive, I am ready to die.”
\p
\v 31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to everyone who had come with them:
\pi I must go and tell the king\fe * \fr 46.31 \fq the king: \ft See the note at 12.15.\fe* that you have arrived from Canaan.
\v 32 I will tell him that you are shepherds and that you have brought your sheep, goats, cattle, and everything else you own.
\v 33 The king will call you in and ask what you do for a living.
\v 34 When he does, be sure to say, “We are shepherds. Our families have always raised sheep.” If you tell him this, he will let you settle in the region of Goshen.
\p Joseph wanted them to say this to the king, because the Egyptians did not like to have anything to do with people who raised sheep.
