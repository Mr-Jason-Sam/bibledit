\ms1 The Lord's promises to Abram
\p
\v 1 Later the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Abram in a vision, “Abram, don't be afraid! I will protect you and reward you greatly.”
\p
\v 2 But Abram answered, “\nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, you have given me everything I could ask for, except children. And when I die, Eliezer of Damascus will get all I own.\fe * \fr Gen. 15.2.\fq And...own: \ft One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text.\fe*
\v 3 You have not given me any children, and this servant of mine will inherit everything.”
\p
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd* replied, “No, he won't! You will have a son of your own, and everything you have will be his.”
\v 5 Then the \nd Lord\nd* took Abram outside and said, “Look at the sky and see if you can count the stars. That's how many descendants you will have.”\x - \xo 15.5: \xt Ro 4.18; He 11.12.\x*
\v 6 Abram believed the \nd Lord\nd*, and the \nd Lord\nd* was pleased with him.\x - \xo 15.6: \xt Ro 4.3; Ga 3.6; Jas 2.23.\x*
\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* makes another promise to Abram
\p
\v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* said to Abram, “I brought you here from Ur in Chaldea, and I gave you this land.”
\p
\v 8 Abram asked, “\nd Lord\nd* God, how can I know the land will be mine?”
\p
\v 9 Then the \nd Lord\nd* told him, “Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.”
\p
\v 10 Abram obeyed the \nd Lord\nd*. Then he cut\fe * \fr Gen. 15.10.\fq cut: \ft In Hebrew “cut” sounds something like “agreement”. What follows shows that the \nd Lord\nd* is making an agreement with Abram.\fe* the animals in half and laid the two halves of each animal opposite each other on the ground. But he did not cut the doves and pigeons in half.
\v 11 And when birds came down to eat the animals, Abram chased them away.
\p
\v 12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and everything became dark and frightening.\x - \xo 15.12: \xt Job 4.13,14.\x*
\v 13-15 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said:\x - \xo 15.13: \xt Ex 1.1-14; Ac 7.6.\x*\x - \xo 15.14: \xt Ex 12.40,41; Ac 7.7.\x*
\pi Abram, you will live to an old age and die in peace.
\pi But I solemnly promise that your descendants will live as foreigners in a land that doesn't belong to them. They will be forced into slavery and abused for four hundred years. But I will terribly punish the nation that enslaves them, and they will leave with many possessions.
\pi
\v 16 Four generations later,\f + \fr 15.16 \fq Four generations later: \ft This may refer to the “four hundred years” of verses 13-15.\f* your descendants will return here and take this land, because only then will the people who live here\fe * \fr Gen. 15.16.\fq people who live here: \ft The Hebrew text has “Amorites”, a name sometimes used of the people who lived in Palestine before the Israelites.\fe* be so sinful that they deserve to be punished.
\p
\v 17 Some time after sunset, when it was very dark, a smoking cooking pot\f + \fr 15.17 \fq smoking cooking pot: \ft One possible meaning for the difficult Hebrew text. The smoke and fire represent the presence of the \nd Lord\nd*.\f* and a flaming fire went between the two halves of each animal.
\v 18 At that time the \nd Lord\nd* made an agreement with Abram and told him:\x - \xo 15.18: \xt Ac 7.5.\x*
\pi I will give your descendants the land east of the River Shihor\f + \fr 15.18 \fq River Shihor: \ft See Joshua 13.2-7.\f* on the border of Egypt as far as the River Euphrates.
\v 19 They will possess the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
\v 20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaites,
\v 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
