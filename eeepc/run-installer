#!/bin/sh

# This calls program ./eeepc-install-menu
# Program ./eeepc-install-menu could have been called straight from the Makefile,
# but on the Macintosh there is a problem that occurs with newer versions of 
# the XCode Tools that cause ./eeepc-install-menu to fail when it is executed.
# The work-around for this is:
# make clean
# make
# sudo make install

# A work-around that is easier for the user is to just call ./eeepc-install-menu
# from this script, and let it always exit 0.

./eeepc-install-menu
exit 0
