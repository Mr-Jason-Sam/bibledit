\ms1 Jesus' last week: his trial and death
\s1 Jesus enters Jerusalem
\r (Mark 11.1-11; Luke 19.28-38; John 12.12-19)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus and his disciples came near Jerusalem, he went to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives and sent two of them on ahead.
\v 2 He told them, “Go into the next village, where you will at once find a donkey and her colt. Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me.
\v 3 If anyone asks why you are doing that, just say, ‘The Lord\fe * \fr 21.3 \fq The Lord: \ft Or “the master of the donkeys”.\fe* needs them.’ Straight away he will let you have the donkeys.”
\p
\v 4 So God's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,
\q1
\v 5 “Announce to the people\x - \xo 21.5: \xt Zec 9.9.\x*
\q2 of Jerusalem:
\q1 ‘Your king is coming to you!
\q1 He is humble
\q2 and rides on a donkey.
\q1 He comes on the colt
\q2 of a donkey.’ ”
\p
\v 6 The disciples left and did what Jesus had told them to do.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and its colt and laid some clothes on their backs. Then Jesus got on.
\p
\v 8 Many people spread clothes in the road, while others put down branches\f + \fr 21.8 \fq spread clothes...put down branches: \ft This was one way that the Jewish people welcomed a famous person.\f* which they had cut from trees.
\v 9 Some people walked ahead of Jesus and others followed behind. They were all shouting,\x - \xo 21.9: \xt Ps 118.25,26.\x*
\q1 “Hooray\f + \fr 21.9 \fq Hooray: \ft This translates a word that can mean “please save us”. But it is most often used as a shout of praise to God.\f* for the Son of David!\f + \fr 21.9 \fq Son of David: \ft See the note at 9.27.\f*
\q1 God bless the one who comes
\q2 in the name of the Lord.
\q1 Hooray for God
\q2 in heaven above!”
\p
\v 10 When Jesus came to Jerusalem, everyone in the city was excited and asked, “Who can this be?”
\p
\v 11 The crowd answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
\s1 Jesus in the temple
\r (Mark 11.15-19; Luke 19.45-48; John 2.13-22)
\p
\v 12 Jesus went into the temple and chased out everyone who was selling or buying. He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of the ones who were selling doves.
\v 13 He told them, “The Scriptures say, ‘My house should be called a place of worship.’ But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide.”\x - \xo 21.13: \xt Is 56.7; Jr 7.11.\x*
\p
\v 14 Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
\v 15 But the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were angry when they saw his miracles and heard the children shouting praises to the Son of David.\f + \fr 21.15 \fq Son of David: \ft See the note at 9.27.\f*
\v 16 The men said to Jesus, “Don't you hear what those children are saying?”\x - \xo 21.16: \xt Ps 8.2 (LXX).\x*
\p “Yes, I do!” Jesus answered. “Don't you know that the Scriptures say, ‘Children and infants will sing praises’?”
\v 17 Then Jesus left the city and went out to the village of Bethany, where he spent the night.
\s1 Jesus puts a curse on a fig tree
\r (Mark 11.12-14,20-24)
\p
\v 18 When Jesus got up the next morning, he was hungry. He started out for the city,
\v 19 and along the way he saw a fig tree. But when he came to it, he found only leaves and no figs. So he told the tree, “You will never again grow any fruit!” At once the fig tree dried up.
\p
\v 20 The disciples were shocked when they saw how quickly the tree had dried up.
\v 21 But Jesus said to them, “If you have faith and don't doubt, I promise that you can do what I did to this tree. And you will be able to do even more. You can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea, and it will.\x - \xo 21.21: \xt Mt 17.20; 1 Co 13.2.\x*
\v 22 If you have faith when you pray, you will be given whatever you ask for.”
\s1 A question about Jesus' authority
\r (Mark 11.27-33; Luke 20.1-8)
\p
\v 23 Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him. They asked, “What right do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
\p
\v 24 Jesus answered, “I have just one question to ask you. If you answer it, I will tell you where I got the right to do these things.
\v 25 Who gave John the right to baptize? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being?”
\p They thought it over and said to each other, “We can't say that God gave John this right. Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John.
\v 26 On the other hand, these people think that John was a prophet, and we are afraid of what they might do to us. That's why we can't say that it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize.”
\v 27 So they told Jesus, “We don't know.”
\p Jesus said, “Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do.”
\s1 A story about two sons
\p
\v 28 Jesus said:
\pi I will tell you a story about a man who had two sons. Then you can tell me what you think. The father went to the elder son and said, “Go and work in the vineyard today!”
\v 29 His son told him that he would not do it, but later he changed his mind and went.
\v 30 The man then told his younger son to go and work in the vineyard. The boy said he would, but he didn't go.
\v 31 Which one of the sons obeyed his father?
\p “The elder one,” the chief priests and leaders answered.
\p Then Jesus told them:
\pi You can be sure that tax collectors\f + \fr 21.31 \fq tax collectors: \ft See the note at 5.46.\f* and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you ever will!
\v 32 When John the Baptist showed you how to do right, you would not believe him. But these evil people did believe. And even when you saw what they did, you still would not change your minds and believe.\x - \xo 21.32: \xt Lk 3.12; 7.29,30.\x*
\s1 Tenants of a vineyard
\r (Mark 12.1-12; Luke 20.9-19)
\p
\v 33 Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story:\x - \xo 21.33: \xt Is 5.1,2.\x*
\pi A land owner once planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it and dug a pit to crush the grapes in. He also built a lookout tower. Then he let his vineyard and left the country.
\pi
\v 34 When it was harvest time, the owner sent some servants to get his share of the grapes.
\v 35 But the tenants grabbed those servants. They beat up one, killed one, and stoned one of them to death.
\v 36 He then sent more servants than he did the first time. But the tenants treated them in the same way.
\pi
\v 37 Finally, the owner sent his own son to the tenants, because he thought they would respect him.
\v 38 But when they saw the man's son, they said, “Some day he will own the vineyard. Let's kill him! Then we can have it all for ourselves.”
\v 39 So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\p
\v 40 Jesus asked, “When the owner of that vineyard comes, what do you suppose he will do to those tenants?”
\p
\v 41 The chief priests and leaders answered, “He will kill them in some horrible way. Then he will let his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time.”
\p
\v 42 Jesus replied, “Surely you know that the Scriptures say,\x - \xo 21.42: \xt Ps 118.22,23.\x*
\q1 ‘The stone that the builders
\q2 tossed aside
\q1 is now the most important
\q2 stone of all.
\q1 This is something
\q1 the Lord has done,
\q2 and it is amazing to us.’
\m
\v 43 I tell you that God's kingdom will be taken from you and given to people who will do what he demands.
\v 44 Anyone who stumbles over this stone will be crushed, and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces.”\fe * \fr 21.44 \fq pieces: \ft Verse 44 is not in some manuscripts.\fe*
\p
\v 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these stories, they knew that Jesus was talking about them.
\v 46 So they looked for a way to arrest Jesus. But they were afraid to, because the people thought he was a prophet.
