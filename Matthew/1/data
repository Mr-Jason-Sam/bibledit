\ms1 The ancestors and birth of Jesus
\s1 The ancestors of Jesus
\r (Luke 3.23-38)
\p
\v 1 Jesus Christ came from the family of King David and also from the family of Abraham. And this is a list of his ancestors.
\v 2-6a From Abraham to King David, his ancestors were:
\p Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and his brothers (Judah's sons were Perez and Zerah, and their mother was Tamar), Hezron;
\p Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Obed (his mother was Ruth), Jesse, and King David.
\p
\v 6b-11 From David to the time of the exile in Babylonia, the ancestors of Jesus were:\x - \xo 1.11: \xt 2 K 24.14,15; 2 Ch 36.10; Jr 27.20.\x*
\p David, Solomon (his mother had been Uriah's wife), Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram;
\p Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, and Jehoiachin and his brothers.
\p
\v 12-16 From the exile to the birth of Jesus, his ancestors were:
\p Jehoiachin, Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim;
\p Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, and Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
\p
\v 17 There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were also fourteen from David to the exile in Babylonia and fourteen more to the birth of the Messiah.
\s1 The birth of Jesus
\r (Luke 2.1-7)
\p
\v 18 This is how Jesus Christ was born. A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David's family. But before they were married, she learnt that she was going to have a baby by God's Holy Spirit.\x - \xo 1.18: \xt Lk 1.27.\x*
\v 19 Joseph was a good man\fe * \fr 1.19 \fq good man: \ft Or “kind man”, or “man who always did the right thing”.\fe* and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone. So he decided to call off the wedding quietly.
\p
\v 20 While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit. Go ahead and marry her.
\v 21 Then after her baby is born, name him Jesus,\f + \fr 1.21 \fq name him Jesus: \ft In Hebrew the name “Jesus” means “the Lord saves”.\f* because he will save his people from their sins.”\x - \xo 1.21: \xt Lk 1.31.\x*
\p
\v 22 So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,
\v 23 “A virgin will have a baby boy, and he will be called Immanuel,” which means “God is with us.”\x - \xo 1.23: \xt Is 7.14 (LXX).\x*
\p
\v 24 After Joseph woke up, he and Mary were soon married, just as the Lord's angel had told him to do.
\v 25 But they did not sleep together before her baby was born. Then Joseph named him Jesus.\x - \xo 1.25: \xt Lk 2.21.\x*
