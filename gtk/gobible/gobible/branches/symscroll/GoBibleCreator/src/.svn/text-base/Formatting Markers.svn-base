Changes to GoBible format:

1. 6 new formatting control characters:
\01 - words of Jesus in red
\02 - add
\03 - name of deity
\04 - quoted
\05 - personal name

2. Line breaks ('\n') allowed

Format change:

3. Description/ titles

To accommodate descriptions/ titles without making major design changes,
the following solution:

<VERSE INDEX 0><\06>For the director of music. Of David.<\07>
In the <\03>LORD<\03> I take refuge. How then can you say to me: ...
<VERSE INDEX 1>For look,...

Keys:
\06
    Will suppress printing a verse number, if it has not been printed, and
    change to boldface for titles.

\07
    Breaks a line, prints the verse number, and resumes normal data.

Verse Numbering:
\08
    Subtracts the verse number by one (as opposed to adding empty verses to
    increase the verse number by one). This has to be repeated for *every*
    verse for which the numbering is not correct.
