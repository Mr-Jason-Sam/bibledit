GoBibleCreator

The GoBibleCreator is available from http://code.google.com/p/gobible/

In November 2009 David Haslam said:

There is no objection in principle to packaging Go Bible Creator with Bibledit, 
especially as it has a significant benefit to translation teams.
There are certain practical requirements that arise.
You should set up a procedure to ensure that what is packaged is always the latest release.

The GoBibleCreator is licenced under the GPL.

The source code is available from http://crosswire.org/svn/gobible
To get the source code do this:

First throw away any subdirectory 'gobible' that may have been created
earlier.
Then export the repository, so it retrieves all files without the .svn
folder:

svn export http://crosswire.org/svn/gobible
