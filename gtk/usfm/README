The file usfmReference[version].chm.zip was downloaded from the above URL,
unzipped and saved as usfmReference.chm.

On 4 August 2009 Jeff Klassen of the Canadian Bible Society gave
permission to distribute this file: 

"Please feel free to distribute the current version of the CHM help file. 
We're glad that the documentation can be of help."

Since it does not come with a license, it is supposed that the file is
in the public domain.

----------------------------

To view this documentation in .chm format, a program called chmsee was used.
People said that this program is not available for Mac OS X.
For that reason the .chm file was extracted into its components.

To extract, move the .chm file to the usfm subdirectory of this package,
then unpack it:
extract_chmLib usfmReference.chm .
Then remove the folders that start with $ and the files starting with #.

It produces .htm files and other files. Since the suffix of the files is .htm, 
these files shouldn't interfere with Bibledit's online help, which uses .html.
Later on the usfm documents were moved to the local web server in their own directory.
Hence there's not going to be interference with anything else at all.

permission to distribute this file: 

"There is no problem with you making use of the usfm.sty file in this way."

Since it does not come with a license, it is supposed that the file is
in the public domain.
