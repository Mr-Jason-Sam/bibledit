\s1 Paul's mission to the Gentiles
\p
\v 1 Christ Jesus made me his prisoner, so that I could help you Gentiles.
\v 2 You have heard about God's kindness in choosing me to help you.
\v 3 In fact, this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways.
\v 4 As you read the letter, you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ.\x - \xo 3.4-6: \xt Col 1.26,27.\x*
\v 5 No one knew about this mystery until God's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets.
\v 6 And the mystery is this: Because of Christ Jesus, the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises that God gave to the Jews. God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body.
\p
\v 7 God treated me with kindness. His power worked in me, and it became my job to spread the good news.
\v 8 I am the least important of all God's people. But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that cannot be measured.
\v 9 God, who created everything, wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind.
\v 10 Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom.
\p
\v 11 God did this according to his eternal plan. And he was able to do what he had planned because of all that Christ Jesus our Lord had done.
\v 12 Christ now gives us courage and confidence, so that we can come to God by faith.
\v 13 That's why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you. After all, it will bring honour to you.
\s1 Christ's love for us
\p
\v 14 I kneel in prayer to the Father.
\v 15 All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him.\fe * \fr 3.15 \fq receive their life from him: \ft Or “know who they really are because of him.”\fe*
\v 16 God is wonderful and glorious. I pray that his Spirit will make you become strong followers
\v 17 and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith. Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love.
\v 18 I pray that you and all God's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep.\f + \fr 3.18 \fq what is called wide or long or high or deep: \ft This may refer to the heavenly Jerusalem or to God's love or wisdom or to the meaning of the cross.\f*
\v 19 I want you to know all about Christ's love, although it is too wonderful to be measured. Then your lives will be filled with all that God is.
\p
\v 20-21 I pray that Christ Jesus and the church will for ever bring praise to God. His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine. Amen.
