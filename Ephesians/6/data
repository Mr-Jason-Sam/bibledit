\c 6
\s1 Children and parents
\p
\v 1 Children, you belong to the Lord, and you do the right thing when you obey your parents. The first commandment with a promise says,\x - \xo 6.1: \xt Col 3.20.\x*
\v 2 “Obey your father and your mother,\x - \xo 6.2,3: \xt Ex 20.12; Dt 5.16.\x*
\v 3 and you will have a long and happy life.”
\p
\v 4 Parents, don't be hard on your children. Raise them properly. Teach them and instruct them about the Lord.\x - \xo 6.4: \xt Col 3.21.\x*
\s1 Slaves and masters
\p
\v 5 Slaves, you must obey your earthly masters. Show them great respect and be as loyal to them as you are to Christ.\x - \xo 6.5-8: \xt Col 3.22-25.\x*
\v 6 Try to please them at all times, and not just when you think they are watching. You are slaves of Christ, so with your whole heart you must do what God wants you to do.
\v 7 Gladly serve your masters, as though they were the Lord himself, and not simply people.
\v 8 You know that you will be rewarded for any good things you do, whether you are slaves or free.
\p
\v 9 Slave owners, you must treat your slaves with this same respect. Don't threaten them. They have the same Master in heaven that you do, and he doesn't have any favourites.\x - \xo 6.9: a \xt Col 4.1; \xo b \xt Dt 10.17; Col 3.25.\x*
\s1 The fight against evil
\p
\v 10 Finally, let the mighty strength of the Lord make you strong.
\v 11 Put on all the armour that God gives, so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks.
\v 12 We are not fighting against humans. We are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world.
\v 13 So put on all the armour that God gives. Then when that evil day\fe * \fr 6.13 \fq that evil day: \ft Either the present (see 5.16) or “the day of death” or “the day of judgment”.\fe* comes, you will be able to defend yourself. And when the battle is over, you will still be standing firm.
\p
\v 14 Be ready! Let the truth be like a belt around your waist, and let God's justice protect you like armour.\x - \xo 6.14: a \xt Is 11.5; \xo b \xt Is 59.17.\x*
\v 15 Your desire to tell the good news about peace should be like shoes on your feet.\x - \xo 6.15: \xt Is 52.7.\x*
\v 16 Let your faith be like a shield, and you will be able to stop all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
\v 17 Let God's saving power be like a helmet, and for a sword use God's message that comes from the Spirit.\x - \xo 6.17: \xt Is 59.17.\x*
\p
\v 18 Never stop praying, especially for others. Always pray by the power of the Spirit. Stay alert and keep praying for God's people.
\v 19 Pray that I will be given the message to speak and that I may fearlessly explain the mystery about the good news.
\v 20 I was sent to do this work, and that's the reason I am in jail. So pray that I will be brave and will speak as I should.
\ms1 Final greetings
\p
\v 21-22 I want you to know how I am getting along and what I am doing. That's why I am sending Tychicus to you. He is a dear friend, as well as a faithful servant of the Lord. He will tell you how I am doing, and he will cheer you up.\x - \xo 6.21: \xt Ac 20.4; 2 Ti 4.12.\x*\x - \xo 6.21,22: \xt Col 4.7,8.\x*
\p
\v 23 I pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give peace, love, and faith to every follower!
\v 24 May God be kind to everyone who keeps on loving our Lord Jesus Christ.
