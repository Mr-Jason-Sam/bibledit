\s1 Paul in Corinth
\p
\v 1 Paul left Athens and went to Corinth,
\v 2 where he met Aquila, a Jewish man from Pontus. Not long before this, Aquila had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome.\f + \fr 18.2 \fq Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome: \ft Probably ad 49, though it may have been ad 41.\f* Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla
\v 3 and found out that they were tent makers. Paul was a tent maker too. So he stayed with them, and they worked together.
\p
\v 4 Every Sabbath, Paul went to the Jewish meeting place. He spoke to Jews and Gentiles\f + \fr 18.4 \fq Gentiles: \ft Here the word is “Greeks”. But see the note at 14.1.\f* and tried to win them over.
\v 5 But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he spent all his time preaching to the Jews about Jesus the Messiah.
\v 6 Finally, they turned against him and insulted him. So he shook the dust from his clothes\f + \fr 18.6 \fq shook the dust from his clothes: \ft This means the same as shaking dust from the feet. See the note at 13.51.\f* and told them, “Whatever happens to you will be your own fault! I am not to blame. From now on I am going to preach to the Gentiles.”
\p
\v 7 Paul then moved into the house of a man named Titius Justus, who worshipped God and lived next door to the Jewish meeting place.
\v 8 Crispus was the leader of the meeting place. He and everyone in his family put their faith in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard the message, and all the people who had faith in the Lord were baptized.
\p
\v 9 One night, Paul had a vision, and in it the Lord said, “Don't be afraid to keep on preaching. Don't stop!
\v 10 I am with you, and you won't be harmed. Many people in this city belong to me.”
\v 11 Paul stayed on in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching God's message to the people.
\p
\v 12 While Gallio was governor of Achaia, some of the Jewish leaders got together and grabbed Paul. They brought him into court
\v 13 and said, “This man is trying to make our people worship God in a way that is against our Law!”
\p
\v 14 Even before Paul could speak, Gallio said, “If you were charging this man with a crime or some other wrong, I would have to listen to you.
\v 15 But since this concerns only words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of it. I refuse to judge such matters.”
\v 16 Then he sent them out of the court.
\v 17 The crowd grabbed Sosthenes, the Jewish leader, and beat him up in front of the court. But none of this mattered to Gallio.
\s1 Paul returns to Antioch in Syria
\p
\v 18 After Paul had stayed for a while with the Lord's followers in Corinth, he said goodbye to them and sailed on to Syria with Aquila and Priscilla. But before he left, he had his head shaved\f + \fr 18.18 \fq he had his head shaved: \ft Paul had promised to be a “Nazirite” for a while. This meant that for the time of the promise, he could not cut his hair or drink wine. When the time was over, he would have to cut his hair and offer a sacrifice to God.\f* at Cenchreae because he had made a promise to God.\x - \xo 18.18: \xt Nu 6.18.\x*
\p
\v 19 The three of them arrived in Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He then went into the Jewish meeting place to talk with the people there.
\v 20 They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.
\v 21 He said goodbye to them and told them, “If God lets me, I will come back.”
\ms1 Paul's third journey to tell the good news
\p
\v 22 Paul sailed to Caesarea, where he greeted the church. Then he went on to Antioch.
\v 23 After staying there for a while, he left and visited several places in Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the followers there to become stronger in their faith.
\s1 Apollos in Ephesus
\p
\v 24 A Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus. Apollos had been born in the city of Alexandria. He was a very good speaker and knew a lot about the Scriptures.
\v 25 He also knew much about the Lord's Way,\f + \fr 18.25 \fq the Lord's Way: \ft See the note at 9.2.\f* and he spoke about it with great excitement. What he taught about Jesus was right, but all he knew was John's message about baptism.
\p
\v 26 Apollos started speaking bravely in the Jewish meeting place. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to their home and helped him understand God's Way even better.
\p
\v 27 Apollos decided to travel through Achaia. So the Lord's followers wrote letters, encouraging the followers there to welcome him. After Apollos arrived in Achaia, he was a great help to everyone who had put their faith in the Lord Jesus because of God's kindness.
\v 28 He got into fierce arguments with the Jewish people, and in public he used the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Messiah.
