\s1 Peter and John heal a lame man
\p
\v 1 The time of prayer\f + \fr 3.1 \fq The time of prayer: \ft Many of the Jewish people prayed in their homes at regular times each day (see Daniel 6.11), and on special occasions they prayed in the temple.\f* was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and Peter and John were going into the temple.
\v 2 A man who had been born lame was being carried to the temple door. Each day he was placed beside this door, known as the Beautiful Gate. He sat there and begged from the people who were going in.
\p
\v 3 The man saw Peter and John entering the temple, and he asked them for money.
\v 4 But they looked straight at him and said, “Look up at us!”
\p
\v 5 The man stared at them and thought he was going to get something.
\v 6 But Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold! But I will give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, get up and start walking.”
\v 7 Peter then took him by the right hand and helped him up.
\p At once the man's feet and ankles became strong,
\v 8 and he jumped up and started walking. He went with Peter and John into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God.
\v 9 Everyone saw him walking around and praising God.
\v 10 They knew that he was the beggar who had been lying beside the Beautiful Gate, and they were completely surprised. They could not imagine what had happened to the man.
\s1 Peter speaks in the temple
\p
\v 11 While the man kept holding on to Peter and John, the whole crowd ran to them in amazement at the place known as Solomon's Porch.\f + \fr 3.11 \fq Solomon's Porch: \ft A public place with tall columns along the east side of the temple.\f*
\v 12 Peter saw that a crowd had gathered, and he said:
\pi Friends, why are you surprised at what has happened? Why are you staring at us? Do you think we have some power of our own? Do you think we were able to make this man walk because we are so religious?
\v 13 The God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and our other ancestors worshipped has brought honour to his Servant\fe * \fr 3.13 \fq Servant: \ft Or “Son”.\fe* Jesus. He is the one you betrayed. You turned against him when he was being tried by Pilate, even though Pilate wanted to set him free.\x - \xo 3.13: \xt Ex 3.15.\x*
\pi
\v 14 You rejected Jesus, who was holy and good. You asked for a murderer to be set free,\x - \xo 3.14: \xt Mt 27.15-23; Mk 15.6-14; Lk 23.13-23; Jn 19.12-15.\x*
\v 15 and you killed the one who leads people to life. But God raised him from death, and all of us can tell you what he has done.
\v 16 You see this man, and you know him. He put his faith in the name of Jesus and was made strong. Faith in Jesus made this man completely well while everyone was watching.
\pi
\v 17 My friends, I am sure that you and your leaders didn't know what you were doing.
\v 18 But God had his prophets tell that his Messiah would suffer, and now he has kept that promise.
\v 19 So turn to God! Give up your sins, and you will be forgiven.
\v 20 Then that time will come when the Lord will give you fresh strength. He will send you Jesus, his chosen Messiah.
\v 21 But Jesus must stay in heaven until God makes all things new, just as his holy prophets promised long ago.
\pi
\v 22 Moses said, “The Lord your God will choose one of your own people to be a prophet, just as he chose me. Listen to everything he tells you.\x - \xo 3.22: \xt Dt 18.15,18 (LXX).\x*
\v 23 No one who disobeys that prophet will be one of God's people any longer.”\x - \xo 3.23: \xt Dt 18.19.\x*
\pi
\v 24 Samuel and all the other prophets who came later also spoke about what is now happening.
\v 25 You are really the ones God told his prophets to speak to. And you were given the promise that God made to your ancestors. He said to Abraham, “All nations on earth will be blessed because of someone from your family.”\x - \xo 3.25: \xt Gn 22.18.\x*
\v 26 God sent his chosen Son\fe * \fr 3.26 \fq Son: \ft Or “Servant”.\fe* to you first, because God wanted to bless you and make each one of you turn away from your sins.
