\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\p
\v 1 Paul and Barnabas spoke in the Jewish meeting place in Iconium, just as they had done at Antioch, and many Jews and Gentiles\f + \fr 14.1 \fq Gentiles: \ft The Greek text has “Greeks”, which probably means people who were not Jews. But it may mean Gentiles who worshipped with the Jews.\f* put their faith in the Lord.
\v 2 But the Jews who did not have faith in him made the other Gentiles angry and turned them against the Lord's followers.
\p
\v 3 Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a while, having faith in the Lord and bravely speaking his message. The Lord gave them the power to perform miracles and wonders, and he showed that their message about his great kindness was true.
\p
\v 4 The people of Iconium did not know what to think. Some of them believed the Jewish group, and others believed the apostles.
\v 5 Finally, some Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to make trouble for Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death.
\p
\v 6-7 But when the two apostles found out what was happening, they escaped to the region of Lycaonia. They preached the good news there in the towns of Lystra and Derbe and in the nearby countryside.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Lystra
\p
\v 8 In Lystra there was a man who had been born with crippled feet and had never been able to walk.
\v 9 The man was listening to Paul speak, when Paul saw that he had faith in Jesus and could be healed. So he looked straight at the man
\v 10 and shouted, “Stand up!” The man jumped up and started walking around.
\p
\v 11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they yelled out in the language of Lycaonia, “The gods have turned into humans and have come down to us!”
\v 12 The people then gave Barnabas the name Zeus, and they gave Paul the name Hermes,\f + \fr 14.12 \fq Hermes: \ft The Greeks thought of Hermes as the messenger of the other gods, especially of Zeus, their chief god.\f* because he did the talking.
\p
\v 13 The temple of Zeus was near the entrance to the city. Its priest and the crowds wanted to offer a sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul. So the priest brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates.
\v 14 When the two apostles found out about this, they tore their clothes in horror and ran to the crowd, shouting:
\pi
\v 15 Why are you doing this? We are humans just like you. Please give up all this foolishness. Turn to the living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.\x - \xo 14.15: \xt Ex 20.11; Ps 146.6.\x*
\v 16 In times past, God let each nation go its own way.
\v 17 But he showed that he was there by the good things he did. God sends rain from heaven and makes your crops grow. He gives food to you and makes your hearts glad.
\p
\v 18 Even after Paul and Barnabas had said all this, they could hardly keep the people from offering a sacrifice to them.
\p
\v 19 Some Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came and turned the crowds against Paul. They hit him with stones and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
\v 20 But when the Lord's followers gathered around Paul, he stood up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas went to Derbe.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to Antioch in Syria
\p
\v 21 Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in Derbe and won some people to the Lord. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in Pisidia.
\v 22 They encouraged the followers and begged them to remain faithful. They told them, “We have to suffer a lot before we can get into God's kingdom.”
\v 23 Paul and Barnabas chose some leaders for each of the churches. Then they went without eating\f + \fr 14.23 \fq went without eating: \ft See the note at 13.2.\f* and prayed that the Lord would take good care of these leaders.
\p
\v 24 Paul and Barnabas went on through Pisidia to Pamphylia,
\v 25 where they preached in the town of Perga. Then they went down to Attalia
\v 26 and sailed to Antioch in Syria. It was there that they had been placed in God's care for the work they had now completed.\f + \fr 14.26 \fq the work they had now completed: \ft See 13.1-3.\f*
\p
\v 27 After arriving in Antioch, they called the church together. They told the people what God had helped them do and how he had made it possible for the Gentiles to believe.
\v 28 Then they stayed there with the followers for a long time.
