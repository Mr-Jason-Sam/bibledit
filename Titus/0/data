\imt About this letter
\im Paul mentions Titus several times in his letters as someone who worked with him in Asia Minor and Greece (2 Corinthians 2.13; 7.6,13; 8.6,16,23; 12.18; Galatians 2.3). He is told by Paul to appoint church leaders and officials in Crete.
\ip Paul instructs Titus to make sure that church leaders and officials have good reputations (1.5-9) and that all the Lord's followers keep themselves pure and avoid arguments (1.10—2.9).
\ip Paul includes special instructions for the different groups within the church in Crete. He reminds Titus that a new way of life is possible because of what God has done by sending Jesus Christ: God has saved them, washed them by the power of the Holy Spirit, and given them a fresh start and the hope of eternal life.
\ip Paul also tells how we are saved:
\iq God our Saviour showed us
\iq2 how good and kind he is.
\iq He saved us because
\iq2 of his mercy,
\iq and not because
\iq of any good things
\iq2 that we have done.
