\c 3
\s1 Doing helpful things
\p
\v 1 Remind your people to obey the rulers and authorities and not to be rebellious. They must always be ready to do something helpful
\v 2 and not say cruel things or argue. They should be gentle and kind to everyone.
\v 3 We used to be stupid, disobedient, and foolish, as well as slaves of all sorts of desires and pleasures. We were evil and jealous. Everyone hated us, and we hated everyone.
\q1
\v 4 God our Saviour showed us
\q2 how good and kind he is.
\q1
\v 5 He saved us because
\q2 of his mercy,
\q1 and not because
\q1 of any good things
\q2 that we have done.
\b
\q1 God washed us by the power
\q2 of the Holy Spirit.
\q1 He gave us new birth
\q2 and a fresh beginning.
\q1
\v 6 God sent Jesus Christ
\q1 our Saviour
\q2 to give us his Spirit.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Jesus treated us much better
\q2 than we deserve.
\q1 He made us acceptable to God
\q1 and gave us the hope
\q2 of eternal life.

\v 8 This message is certainly true.
\p These teachings are useful and helpful for everyone. I want you to insist that the people follow them, so that all who have faith in God will be sure to do good deeds.
\v 9 But don't have anything to do with stupid arguments about ancestors. And stay away from disagreements and quarrels about the Law of Moses. Such arguments are useless and senseless.
\p
\v 10 Warn troublemakers once or twice. Then don't have anything else to do with them.
\v 11 You know that their minds are twisted, and their own sins show how guilty they are.
