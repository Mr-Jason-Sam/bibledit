\mt2 Paul's first letter to the church in Thessalonica
\imt About this letter
\im Paul started the church in Thessalonica (2.13,14), while working hard to support himself (2.9). In this important city of northern Greece, many of the followers had worshipped idols before becoming Christians (1.9). But they were faithful to the Lord, and because of them the Lord's message had spread everywhere in that region (1.8). This letter may have been the first one that Paul wrote, and perhaps even the first of all the New Testament writings.
\ip Some people in Thessalonica began to oppose Paul, and he had to escape to Athens. But he sent his young friend Timothy to find out how the Christians were doing (3.1-5). When Timothy returned, he gave Paul good reports of their faith and love (3.6-10).
\ip The church itself had problems. Some of its members had stopped working, since they thought that the Lord would soon return (4.11,12). Others were worried because relatives and friends had already died before Christ's return. So Paul tried to explain to them more clearly what would happen when the Lord returns (4.13-15), and then told them how they should live meanwhile (5.1-11).
\ip Paul's final instructions are well worth remembering:
\imq Always be joyful and never stop praying. Whatever happens, keep thanking God because of Jesus Christ. This is what God wants you to do.
