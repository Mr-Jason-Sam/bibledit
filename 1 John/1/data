\ms1 The Word that gives life
\q1
\v 1 The Word that gives life\x - \xo 1.1: \xt Jn 1.1.\x*
\q2 was from the beginning,
\q1 and this is the one
\q2 our message is about.
\b
\q1 Our ears have heard,
\q2 our own eyes have seen,
\q1 and our hands touched
\q2 this Word.
\p
\v 2 The one who gives life appeared! We saw it happen, and we are witnesses to what we have seen. Now we are telling you about this eternal life that was with the Father and appeared to us.\x - \xo 1.2: \xt Jn 1.14.\x*
\v 3 We are telling you what we have seen and heard, so that you may share in this life with us. And we share in it with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
\v 4 We are writing to tell you these things, because this makes us\fe * \fr 1.4 \fq us: \ft Some manuscripts have “you”.\fe* truly happy.
\ms1 God is light and Christ is our example
\p
\v 5 Jesus told us that God is light and doesn't have any darkness in him. Now we are telling you.
\p
\v 6 If we say that we share in life with God and keep on living in the dark, we are lying and are not living by the truth.
\v 7 But if we live in the light, as God does, we share in life with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away.
\v 8 If we say that we have not sinned, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth isn't in our hearts.
\v 9 But if we confess our sins to God, he can always be trusted to forgive us and take our sins away.
\p
\v 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and his message isn't in our hearts.\fe * \fr 1.10 \fq and his message isn't in our hearts: \ft Or “because we have not accepted his message.”\fe*
