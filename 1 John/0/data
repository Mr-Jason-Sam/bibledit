\mt2 John's first letter
\imt About this letter
\im John wants Christian believers to know that when we tell God about our sins, God will forgive us and take them away (1.9).
\ip The true test of faith is love for each other (3.11-24). Because God is love, his people must be like him (4.1-21). For a complete victory over sin, we must not only love others, but we must believe that Jesus, the Son of God, is truly Christ, and that his death for us was real (5.1-12).
\ip Remember:
\iq The Word that gives life
\iq2 was from the beginning,
\iq and this is the one
\iq2 our message is about.
