\ms1 The Lord's love for Israel
\p
\v 1 I am Malachi. And this is the message that the \nd Lord\nd* gave me for Israel.
\s1 The \nd Lord\nd*'s love for Israel
\p
\v 2 Israel, I, the \nd Lord\nd*, have loved you. And yet you ask in what way have I loved you. Don't forget that Esau was the brother of your ancestor Jacob, but I chose Jacob\x - \xo 1.2,3: \xt Ro 9.13.\x*\x - \xo 1.2-5: \xt Is 34.5-17; 63.1-6; Jr 49.7-22; Ez 25.12-14; 35.1-15; Am 1.11,12; Ob 1-14.\x*
\v 3 instead of Esau. And I turned Esau's hill country into a barren desert where jackals\f + \fr 1.3 \fq jackals: \ft Desert animals related to wolves, but smaller.\f* roam.
\v 4 Esau's descendants may say, “Although our nation Edom is in ruins, we will rebuild.”
\p But I, the \nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, promise to tear down whatever they build. Then everyone will know that I will never stop being angry with them as long as they are so sinful.
\p
\v 5 Israel, when you see this, you will shout, “The \nd Lord\nd*'s great reputation reaches beyond our borders.”
\ms1 Against the priests
\p
\v 6 I, the \nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, have something to say to you priests. Children respect their fathers, and servants respect their masters. I am your father and your master, so why don't you respect me? You priests have insulted me, and now you ask, “How did we insult you?”
\p
\v 7 You embarrass me by offering worthless food on my altar. Then you ask, “How have we embarrassed you?” You have done it by saying, “What's so great about the \nd Lord\nd*'s altar?”
\p
\v 8 But isn't it wrong to offer animals that are blind, crippled, or sick? Just try giving those animals to your governor. That certainly wouldn't please him or make him want to help you.\x - \xo 1.8: \xt Dt 15.21.\x*
\v 9 I am the \nd Lord\nd* God All-Powerful, and you had better try to please me. You have sinned. Now see if I will have mercy on any of you.
\p
\v 10 I wish someone would lock the doors of my temple, so you would stop wasting time building fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you priests, and I refuse to accept any more of your offerings.
\v 11 From dawn until dusk my name is praised by every nation on this earth, as they burn incense and offer the proper sacrifices to me.
\v 12 But even you priests insult me by saying, “There's nothing special about the \nd Lord\nd*'s altar, and these sacrifices are worthless.”
\p
\v 13 You get so disgusted that you even make vulgar signs at me.\fe * \fr 1.13 \fq me: \ft Or “the altar”.\fe* And for an offering, you bring stolen\fe * \fr 1.13 \fq stolen: \ft Or “injured”.\fe* animals or those that are crippled or sick. Should I accept these?
\v 14 Instead of offering the acceptable animals you have promised, you bring me those that are unhealthy. I will punish you for this, because I am the great King, the \nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, and I am worshipped by nations everywhere.
