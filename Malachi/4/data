\s1 The day of judgment
\sp The \nd Lord\nd* said:
\p
\v 1 The day of judgment is certain to come. And it will be like a red-hot furnace with flames that burn up proud and sinful people, as though they were straw. Not a branch or a root will be left. I, the \nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, have spoken!
\v 2 But for you who honour my name, victory will shine like the sun with healing in its rays, and you will jump around like calves at play.
\v 3 When I come to bring justice, you will trample those who are evil, as though they were ashes under your feet. I, the \nd Lord\nd* All-Powerful, have spoken!
\p
\v 4 Don't ever forget the laws and teachings I gave my servant Moses on Mount Sinai.\fe * \fr 4.4 \fq Sinai: \ft Hebrew “Horeb”.\fe*
\p
\v 5 I, the \nd Lord\nd*, promise to send the prophet Elijah before that great and terrible day comes.\x - \xo 4.5: \xt Mt 11.14; 17.10-13; Mk 9.11-13; Lk 1.17; Jn 1.21.\x*
\v 6 He will lead children and parents to love each other more, so that when I come, I won't bring doom to the land.
