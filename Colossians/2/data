\c 2
\p
\v 1 I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you, for God's people at Laodicea, and for all those followers who have never met me.
\v 2 I do it to encourage them. Then as their hearts are joined together in love, they will be wonderfully blessed with complete understanding. And they will truly know Christ. Not only is he the key to God's mystery,
\v 3 but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him.
\v 4 I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk.
\v 5 Even though I am not with you, I keep thinking about you. I am glad to know that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong.
\s1 Christ brings real life
\p
\v 6 You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord. Now keep on following him.
\v 7 Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be grateful.
\p
\v 8 Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments. These arguments may sound wise, but they are only human teachings. They come from the powers of this world\f + \fr 2.8 \fq powers of this world: \ft Spirits and unseen forces were thought to control human lives and were believed to be connected with the movements of the stars.\f* and not from Christ.
\p
\v 9 God lives fully in Christ.
\v 10 And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ, who is over every power and authority.
\v 11 Christ has also taken away your selfish desires, just as circumcision removes flesh from the body.
\v 12 And when you were baptized, it was the same as being buried with Christ. Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God, who raised Christ from death.\x - \xo 2.12: \xt Ro 6.4.\x*
\v 13 You were dead, because you were sinful and were not God's people. But God let Christ make you\fe * \fr 2.13 \fq you: \ft See the note at 1.7.\fe* alive, when he forgave all our sins.\x - \xo 2.13: \xt Eph 2.1-5.\x*
\p
\v 14 God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses. He took them away and nailed them to the cross.\x - \xo 2.14: \xt Eph 2.15.\x*
\v 15 There Christ defeated all powers and forces. He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory.
\p
\v 16 Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink. Don't let them say that you must celebrate the New Moon festival, the Sabbath, or any other festival.\x - \xo 2.16: \xt Rom 14.1-6.\x*
\v 17 These things are only a shadow of what was to come. But Christ is real!
\p
\v 18 Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels.\fe * \fr 2.18 \fq worship angels: \ft Or “worship with angels (in visions of heaven)”.\fe* They boast about seeing visions. But it is all nonsense, because their minds are filled with selfish desires.
\v 19 They are no longer part of Christ, who is the head of the whole body. Christ gives the body its strength, and he uses its joints and muscles to hold it together, as it grows by the power of God.\x - \xo 2.19: \xt Eph 4.16.\x*
\ms1 New life with Christ
\p
\v 20 You died with Christ. Now the forces of the universe\f + \fr 2.20 \fq forces of the universe: \ft See the note at 2.8.\f* don't have any power over you. Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as,
\v 21 “Don't handle this. Don't taste that. Don't touch this.”?
\v 22 After these things are used, they are no longer good for anything. So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up?
\v 23 Obeying these rules may seem to be the clever thing to do. They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body. But they don't really have any power over our desires.
