/*
Some information about how XEP does hyphenation follows below:


The entity for a nonbreaking hyphen is as in these names: 
's&#8209;Gravenhage or 's&#x2011;Gravenhage.

There are hyphenation files available from Tex/LaTex, with rules in them.
But bibledit does not use them.

In XEP every paragraph that gets hyphenated automatically needs: hyphenate="true"

XEP 4.4 uses Unicode soft hyphen characters (U+00AD) (&#173;) to mark possible 
hyphenation points. These characters can be contained in the source XSL FO 
document (e.g. come from an external hyphenation software). XEP can also add 
them inside: it contains a hyphenator class that inserts soft hyphens to all 
text data before they are passed to the formatter.
Bibledit only uses the soft hyphen character.


Unicode has a non-breaking hyphen character - &#x2011; - This is &#8209;.
There is also the normal hyphen, &#8208;. 
This can be used in combination with the soft hyphen, so it only breaks once.


Generally, to hyphenate, in the .fo file, set hyphenate="false", and use soft 
hyphens.
