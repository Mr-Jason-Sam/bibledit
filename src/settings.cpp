Before this we used to retrieve every setting from the databases,

This made bibledit sluggish in cases where many values were needed at once.
This new object is a much faster, in-memory, system for the settings.
It loads a value the first time it is requested, 
and then keeps it in memory for the rest of the time.
It will write the values back to disk on object destruction.
