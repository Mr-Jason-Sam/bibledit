 Todo 
 
 When translating, and going to a certain verse, the user wishes to see
 all of the keyterms found in that verse, and what word they have chosen for
 it in their own language.
 This is going to be one tool in one window. No controls in that window.
 It's a GtkTextView that shows all in simple order. No fancy things.

 When this tool is chosen, it pops up as a window and tiles itself in the Tools area.
 We need a generic routine for that.
 The routine looks for empty space within constraints. It can make other windows smaller.
 When a window closes, the other windows are left as they are. 
 Thus if the same window is opened again, it will go in the same free space as it was before.
