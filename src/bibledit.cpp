     We used a trick to get Bibledit to operate as a true activity on OLPC. 
     The problem is that any regular X11 program that is started, 
     eg by os.system in an activity.py, appears as an extra icon in the "wheel" on the home screen, 
     and sugar doesn't see it as being connected in any way with the original activity that started it. 
     It will also have a generic icon.
     So I decided to use GTK's cross-process embedding (GtkSocket/GtkPlug) 
     to make the Bibledit window be a pane inside the Python activity's window. 
     This uses the XEmbed protocol behind the scenes, and requires a window ID to be passed to Bibledit. 
     You can then quit Bibledit from the File menu, and the activity goes away, 
     or you can Stop the activity and Bibledit goes away.
     I changed Bibledit to accept a --xembed argument with a window ID. 
     It that argument is present, it then creates a plug for its main window instead of a normal top-level window.
