To checkout xiphos:
svn co https://gnomesword.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnomesword/trunk xiphos


Bazaar repository with xiphos with ipc - work in progress:
Xiphos before being committed to svn.
bzr branch http://www.chaqar.com/bzr/xiphos-ipc xiphos-ipc
From there on, it's fairly straightforward. Just ./autogen as you
normally would. There is one thing you'll have to do manually:
cd src/gnome2
dbus-binding-tool --prefix=ipc_object --mode=glib-server ipc-interface.xml > "ipc-server-stub.h"
After that, make should 'just work'.
To make the client, do this:
cd src/gnome2
make -f receive_make client
and run with ./client. Due to how this is currently programmed, I
think you'll have to start Xiphos before starting the client. I'll
change the client at some point so that shouldn't be necessary.
So, what does it do? Well, using d-feet or some other dbus explorer,
you can call the function "navigate" with sword://Gen 1:1, and Xiphos
will navigate to that. The client will listen on dbus for Xiphos to
emit a "performSearch" signal. This is emitted every time you do a
search in the sidebar (can be easily extended to advanced search).
When this occurs, the client will print the search term to the
terminal. I have a function in place that will allow the client to
then ask for the search results, but it isn't hooked up yet in Xiphos.
