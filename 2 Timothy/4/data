\v 1 When Christ Jesus comes as king, he will be the judge of everyone, whether they are living or dead. So with God and Christ as witnesses, I command you
\v 2 to preach God's message. Do it willingly, even if it isn't the popular thing to do. You must correct people and point out their sins. But also cheer them up, and when you instruct them, always be patient.
\v 3 The time is coming when people won't listen to good teaching. Instead, they will look for teachers who will please them by telling them only what they are itching to hear.
\v 4 They will turn from the truth and eagerly listen to senseless stories.
\v 5 But you must stay calm and be willing to suffer. You must work hard to tell the good news and to do your job well.
\p
\v 6 Now the time has come for me to die. My life is like a drink offering\f + \fr 4.6 \fq drink offering: \ft Water or wine was sometimes poured out as an offering when an animal sacrifice was made.\f* being poured out on the altar.
\v 7 I have fought well. I have finished the race, and I have been faithful.
\v 8 So a crown will be given to me for pleasing the Lord. He judges fairly, and on the day of judgment he will give a crown to me and to everyone else who wants him to appear with power.

\v 9 Come to see me as soon as you can.

\v 13 When you come, bring the coat I left at Troas with Carpus.

\v 15 Alexander opposes what we preach. You had better watch out for him.
\p
\v 16 When I was first put on trial, no one helped me. In fact, everyone deserted me. I hope it won't be held against them.
\v 17 But the Lord stood beside me. He gave me the strength to tell his full message, so that all Gentiles would hear it. And I was kept safe from hungry lions.
\v 18 The Lord will always keep me from being harmed by evil, and he will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. Praise him for ever and ever! Amen.
