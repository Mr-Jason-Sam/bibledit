\ms1 What people will be like in the last days
\p
\v 1 You can be certain that in the last days there will be some very hard times.
\v 2 People will love only themselves and money. They will be proud, stuck-up, rude, and disobedient to their parents. They will also be ungrateful, godless,
\v 3 heartless, and hateful. Their words will be cruel, and they will have no self-control or pity. These people will hate everything that is good.
\v 4 They will be sneaky, reckless, and puffed up with pride. Instead of loving God, they will love pleasure.
\v 5 Even though they will make a show of being religious, their religion won't be real. Don't have anything to do with such people.
\p
\v 6 Some men fool whole families, just to get power over those women who are slaves of sin and are controlled by all sorts of desires.
\v 7 These women always want to learn something new, but they never can discover the truth.
\v 8 Just as Jannes and Jambres\f + \fr 3.8 \fq Jannes and Jambres: \ft These names are not found in the Old Testament. But many believe these were the names of the two Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses when he wanted to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt. See Exodus 7.11,22.\f* opposed Moses, these people are enemies of the truth. Their minds are sick, and their faith isn't real.\x - \xo 3.8: \xt Ex 7.11.\x*
\v 9 But they won't get very far with their foolishness. Soon everyone will know the truth about them, just as Jannes and Jambres were found out.
\ms1 Keep being faithful
\s1 Paul's last instructions to Timothy
\p
\v 10 Timothy, you know what I teach and how I live. You know what I want to do and what I believe. You have seen how patient and loving I am, and how in the past I put up with
\v 11 trouble and suffering in the cities of Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Yet the Lord rescued me from all those terrible troubles.\x - \xo 3.11: a \xt Ac 13.14-52; \xo b \xt Ac 14.1-7; \xo c \xt Ac 14.8-20.\x*
\v 12 Anyone who belongs to Christ Jesus and wants to live right will have trouble from others.
\v 13 But evil people who pretend to be what they are not will become worse than ever, as they fool others and are fooled themselves.
\p
\v 14 Keep on being faithful to what you were taught and to what you believed. After all, you know who taught you these things.
\v 15 Since childhood, you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise enough to have faith in Christ Jesus and be saved.
\v 16 Everything in the Scriptures is God's Word. All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live.
\v 17 The Scriptures train God's servants to do all kinds of good deeds.
