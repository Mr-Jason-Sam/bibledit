\v 1 We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ. We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God.
\v 2 And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms\fe * \fr 6.2 \fq baptisms: \ft Or “ceremonies of washing”.\fe* or about the laying on of hands\f + \fr 6.2 \fq laying on of hands: \ft This was a ceremony in which church leaders and others put their hands on people to show that those people were chosen to do some special kind of work.\f* or about people being raised from death and the future judgment.
\v 3 Let's grow up, if God is willing.
\p
\v 4-6 But what about people who turn away after they have already seen the light and have received the gift from heaven and have shared in the Holy Spirit? What about those who turn away after they have received the good message of God and the powers of the future world? There is no way to bring them back. What they are doing is the same as nailing the Son of God to a cross and insulting him in public!
\p
\v 7 A field is useful to farmers, if there is enough rain to make good crops grow. In fact, God will bless that field.
\v 8 But land that produces only thorn bushes is worthless. It is likely to fall under God's curse, and in the end it will be set on fire.\x - \xo 6.8: \xt Gn 3.17,18.\x*
\p
\v 9 My friends, we are talking this way. But we are sure that you are doing those really good things that people do when they are being saved.
\v 10 God is always fair. He will remember how you helped his people in the past and how you are still helping them. You belong to God, and he won't forget the love you have shown his people.
\v 11 We wish that each of you would always be eager to show how strong and lasting your hope really is.
\v 12 Then you would never be lazy. You would be following the example of those who had faith and were patient until God kept his promise to them.
\s1 God's promise is sure
\p
\v 13 No one is greater than God. So he made a promise in his own name when he said to Abraham,
\v 14 “I, the Lord, will bless you with many descendants!”\x - \xo 6.14: \xt Gn 22.16,17.\x*
\v 15 Then after Abraham had been very patient, he was given what God had promised.
\v 16 When anyone wants to settle an argument, they make a vow by using the name of someone or something greater than themselves.
\v 17 So when God wanted to prove for certain that his promise to his people could not be broken, he made a vow.
\v 18 God cannot tell lies! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed.
\p We have run to God for safety. Now his promises should greatly encourage us to take hold of the hope that is right in front of us.
\v 19 This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls. In fact, hope reaches behind the curtain\f + \fr 6.19 \fq behind the curtain: \ft In the tent that was used for worship, a curtain separated the “holy place” from the “most holy place”, which only the high priest could enter.\f* and into the most holy place.\x - \xo 6.19: \xt Lv 16.2.\x*
\v 20 Jesus has gone there ahead of us, and he is our high priest for ever, just like Melchizedek.\f + \fr 6.20 \fq Melchizedek: \ft See the note at 5.6.\f*\x - \xo 6.20: \xt Ps 110.4.\x*
