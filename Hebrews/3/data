\ms1 Jesus is greater than Moses and Joshua
\p
\v 1 My friends, God has chosen you to be his holy people. So think about Jesus, the one we call our apostle and high priest!
\v 2 Jesus was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in serving all\fe * \fq all: \ft Some manuscripts do not have this word.\fe* God's people.\x - \xo 3.2: \xt Nu 12.7.\x*
\v 3 But Jesus deserves more honour than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves more honour than the house.
\v 4 Of course, every house is built by someone, and God is really the one who built everything.
\p
\v 5 Moses was a faithful servant and told God's people what would be said in the future.
\v 6 But Christ is the Son in charge of God's people. And we are those people, if we keep on being brave and don't lose hope.
\s1 A rest for God's people
\p
\v 7 It is just as the Holy Spirit says,\x - \xo 3.7-11: \xt Ps 95.7-11 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “If you hear God's voice today,
\q2
\v 8 don't be stubborn!
\q1 Don't rebel like those people
\q1 who were tested
\q2 in the desert.
\q1
\v 9-10 For forty years your ancestors
\q1 tested God and saw
\q2 the things he did.
\b
\q1 “Then God got tired of them
\q2 and said,
\q1 ‘You people never
\q2 show good sense,
\q1 and you don't understand
\q2 what I want you to do.’
\q1
\v 11 God became angry
\q2 and told the people,
\q1 ‘You will never enter
\q2 my place of rest!’ ”
\p
\v 12 My friends, watch out! Don't let evil thoughts or doubts make any of you turn from the living God.
\v 13 You must encourage one another each day. And you must keep on while there is still a time that can be called “today”. If you don't, then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn.
\v 14 We were sure about Christ when we first became his people. So let's hold tightly to our faith until the end.
\v 15 The Scriptures say,\x - \xo 3.15: \xt Ps 95.7,8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “If you hear his voice today,
\q1 don't be stubborn
\q2 like those who rebelled.”
\p
\v 16 Who were those people that heard God's voice and rebelled? Weren't they the same ones that came out of Egypt with Moses?\x - \xo 3.16-18: \xt Nu 14.1-35.\x*
\v 17 Who were the people that made God angry for forty years? Weren't they the ones that sinned and died in the desert?
\v 18 And who did God say would never enter his place of rest? Weren't they the ones that disobeyed him?
\v 19 We see that those people did not enter the place of rest because they did not have faith.
