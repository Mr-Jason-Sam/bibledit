\ms1 The greatness of God's Son
\p
\v 1 Long ago in many ways and at many times God's prophets spoke his message to our ancestors.
\v 2 But now at last, God sent his Son to bring his message to us. God created the universe by his Son, and everything will some day belong to the Son.
\v 3 God's Son has all the brightness of God's own glory and is like him in every way. By his own mighty word, he holds the universe together.
\p After the Son had washed away our sins, he sat down at the right side\f + \fr 1.3 \fq right side: \ft The place of honour and power.\f* of the glorious God in heaven.
\v 4 He had become much greater than the angels, and the name he was given is far greater than any of theirs.
\ms1 Jesus is greater than angels
\q1
\v 5 God has never said\x - \xo 1.5: a \xt Ps 2.7; \xo b \xt 2 S 7.14; 1 Ch 17.13.\x*
\q2 to any of the angels,
\q1 “You are my Son, because today
\q2 I have become your Father!”
\q1 Neither has God said
\q2 to any of them,
\q1 “I will be his Father,
\q2 and he will be my Son!”
\p
\v 6 When God brings his firstborn Son\f + \fr 1.6 \fq firstborn Son: \ft The first son born into a family had certain privileges that the other children did not have. In 12.23 “firstborn” refers to God's special people.\f* into the world, he commands all his angels to worship him.\x - \xo 1.6: \xt Dt 32.43 (LXX).\x*
\p
\v 7 And when God speaks about the angels, he says,\x - \xo 1.7: \xt Ps 104.4 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “I change my angels into wind
\q1 and my servants
\q2 into flaming fire.”
\b
\p
\v 8 But God says about his Son,\x - \xo 1.8,9: \xt Ps 45.6,7.\x*
\q1 “You are God,
\q1 and you will rule
\q2 as King for ever!
\q1 Your\fe * \fr 1.8 \fq Your: \ft Some manuscripts have “His”.\fe* royal power
\q2 brings about justice.
\q1
\v 9 You loved justice
\q2 and hated evil,
\q1 and so I, your God,
\q2 have chosen you.
\q1 I appointed you
\q1 and made you happier
\q2 than any of your friends.”
\b
\p
\v 10 The Scriptures also say,\x - \xo 1.10-12: \xt Ps 102.25-27 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “In the beginning, Lord,
\q2 you were the one
\q1 who laid the foundation
\q1 of the earth
\q2 and created the heavens.
\q1
\v 11 They will all disappear
\q1 and wear out like clothes,
\q2 but you will last for ever.
\q1
\v 12 You will roll them up
\q2 like a robe
\q1 and change them
\q2 like a garment.
\q1 But you are always the same,
\q2 and you will live for ever.”
\b
\q1
\v 13 God never said to any\x - \xo 1.13: \xt Ps 110.1.\x*
\q2 of the angels,
\q1 “Sit at my right side
\q1 until I make your enemies
\q2 into a footstool for you!”
\p
\v 14 Angels are merely spirits sent to serve people who are going to be saved.
