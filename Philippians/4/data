\v 1 Dear friends, I love you and long to see you. Please keep on being faithful to the Lord. You are my pride and joy.
\s1 Paul encourages the Lord's followers
\p
\v 2 Euodia and Syntyche, you belong to the Lord, so I beg you to stop arguing with each other.
\v 3 And, my true partner,\fe * \fr 4.3 \fq partner: \ft Or “Syzygus”, a person's name.\fe* I ask you to help them. These women have worked together with me and with Clement and with the others in spreading the good news. Their names are now written in the book of life.\f + \fr 4.3 \fq the book of life: \ft A book in which the names of God's people are written.\f*
\p
\v 4 Always be glad because of the Lord! I will say it again: be glad.
\v 5 Always be gentle with others. The Lord will soon be here.
\v 6 Don't worry about anything, but pray about everything. With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God.
\v 7 Then, because you belong to Christ Jesus, God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand. And this peace will control the way you think and feel.
\p
\v 8 Finally, my friends, keep your minds on whatever is true, pure, right, holy, friendly, and proper. Don't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise.
\v 9 You know the teachings I gave you, and you know what you heard me say and saw me do. So follow my example. And God, who gives peace, will be with you.
\ms1 Paul thanks the Philippians
\p
\v 10 The Lord has made me very grateful that at last you have thought about me once again. Actually, you were thinking about me all along, but you didn't have any chance to show it.
\v 11 I am not complaining about having too little. I have learnt to be satisfied with\fe * \fr 4.11 \fq be satisfied with: \ft Or “get by on”.\fe* whatever I have.
\v 12 I know what it is to be poor or to have plenty, and I have lived under all kinds of conditions. I know what it means to be full or to be hungry, to have too much or too little.
\v 13 Christ gives me the strength to face anything.
\p
\v 14 It was good of you to help me when I was having such a hard time.
\v 15 My friends at Philippi, you remember what it was like when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia.\f + \fr 4.15 \fq when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia: \ft Paul is talking about his first visit to Philippi. See Acts 16.12-40.\f* After I left there, you were the only church that became my partner by giving blessings and by receiving them in return.\x - \xo 4.15,16: \xt 2 Co 11.9.\x*
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you helped me more than once.\x - \xo 4.16: \xt Ac 17.1.\x*
\v 17 I am not trying to get something from you, but I want you to receive the blessings that come from giving.
\p
\v 18 I have been paid back everything, and with interest. I am completely satisfied with the gifts that you asked Epaphroditus to bring me. They are like a sweet-smelling offering or like the right kind of sacrifice that pleases God.\x - \xo 4.18: \xt Ex 29.18.\x*
\v 19 I pray that God will take care of all your needs with the wonderful blessings that come from Christ Jesus!
\v 20 May God our Father be praised for ever and ever. Amen.
\ms1 Final greetings

\p The Lord's followers here with me send you their greetings.
\p
\v 22 All God's people send their greetings, especially those in the service of the Emperor.
\p
\v 23 I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless your life!
