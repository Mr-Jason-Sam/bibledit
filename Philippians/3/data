\ms1 Being acceptable to God
\p
\v 1 Finally, my dear friends, be glad that you belong to the Lord. It doesn't bother me to write the same things to you that I have written before. In fact, it is for your own good.
\p
\v 2 Watch out for those people who behave like dogs! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you.
\v 3 But we are the ones who are truly circumcised, because we worship by the power of God's Spirit\fe * \fr 3.3 \fq by the power of God's Spirit: \ft Some manuscripts have “sincerely”.\fe* and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don't boast about what we have done,
\v 4 although I could. Others may boast about themselves, but I have more reason to boast than anyone else.
\v 5 I was circumcised when I was eight days old,\f + \fr 3.5 \fq when I was eight days old: \ft Jewish boys are circumcised eight days after birth.\f* and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a true Hebrew. As a Pharisee, I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses.\x - \xo 3.5: a \xt Ro 11.1; \xo b \xt Ac 23.6; 26.5.\x*
\v 6 And I was so eager that I even made trouble for the church. I did everything the Law demands in order to please God.\x - \xo 3.6: \xt Ac 8.3; 22.4; 26.9-11.\x*
\p
\v 7 But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless.
\v 8 Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have given up everything else and count it all as rubbish. All I want is Christ
\v 9 and to know that I belong to him. I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses. God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ.
\v 10 All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life. I want to suffer and die as he did,
\v 11 so that somehow I also may be raised to life.
\s1 Running towards the goal
\p
\v 12 I have not yet reached my goal, and I am not perfect. But Christ has taken hold of me. So I keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize.
\v 13 My friends, I don't feel that I have already arrived. But I forget what is behind, and I struggle for what is ahead.
\v 14 I run towards the goal, so that I can win the prize of being called to heaven. This is the prize that God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done.
\v 15 All of us who are mature should think in this same way. And if any of you think differently, God will make it clear to you.
\v 16 But we must keep going in the direction that we are now headed.
\p
\v 17 My friends, I want you to follow my example and learn from others who closely follow the example we set for you.\x - \xo 3.17: \xt 1 Co 4.16; 11.1.\x*
\v 18 I often warned you that many people are living as enemies of the cross of Christ. And now with tears in my eyes, I warn you again
\v 19 that they are headed for hell! They worship their stomachs and boast about the disgusting things they do. All they can think about are the things of this world.
\p
\v 20 But we are citizens of heaven and are eagerly waiting for our Saviour to come from there. Our Lord Jesus Christ
\v 21 has power over everything, and he will make these poor bodies of ours like his own glorious body.
