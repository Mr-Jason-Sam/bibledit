\ms1 Christ's example of true humility
\p
\v 1 Christ encourages you, and his love comforts you. God's Spirit unites you, and you are concerned for others.
\v 2 Now make me completely happy! Live in harmony by showing love for each other. Be united in what you think, as if you were only one person.
\v 3 Don't be jealous or proud, but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves.
\v 4 Care about them as much as you care about yourselves
\v 5 and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought:\fe * \fr 2.5 \fq think the same way that Christ Jesus thought: \ft Or “think the way you should because you belong to Christ Jesus.”\fe*
\q1
\v 6 Christ was truly God.
\q1 But he did not try to remain\fe * \fr 2.6 \fq remain: \ft Or “become”.\fe*
\q2 equal with God.
\q1
\v 7 Instead he gave up everything\fe * \fr 2.7 \fq he gave up everything: \ft Greek, “He emptied himself”.\fe*
\q2 and became a slave,
\q1 when he became
\q2 like one of us.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Christ was humble.
\q1 He obeyed God and even died
\q2 on a cross.
\q1
\v 9 Then God gave Christ
\q2 the highest place
\q1 and honoured his name
\q2 above all others.
\b
\q1
\v 10 So at the name of Jesus\x - \xo 2.10,11: \xt Is 45.23 (LXX).\x*
\q2 everyone will bow down,
\q1 those in heaven, on earth,
\q2 and under the earth.
\q1
\v 11 And to the glory
\q2 of God the Father
\q1 everyone will openly agree,
\q2 “Jesus Christ is Lord!”
\s1 Lights in the world
\p
\v 12 My dear friends, you always obeyed when I was with you. Now that I am away, you should obey even more. So work with fear and trembling to discover what it really means to be saved.
\v 13 God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him.
\p
\v 14 Do everything without grumbling or arguing.
\v 15 Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God. You live among people who are crooked and evil, but you must not do anything that they can say is wrong. Try to shine as lights among the people of this world,\x - \xo 2.15: \xt Dt 32.5.\x*
\v 16 as you hold firmly to\fe * \fr 2.16 \fq hold firmly to: \ft Or “offer them”.\fe* the message that gives life. Then on the day when Christ returns, I can take pride in you. I can also know that my work and efforts were not useless.
\p
\v 17 Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him. And my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice.\f + \fr 2.17 \fq my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice: \ft Offerings of water or wine were sometimes poured out when animals were sacrificed on the altar.\f* If this happens, I will be glad and rejoice with you.
\v 18 In the same way, you should be glad and rejoice with me.
\ms1 News about Paul's friends
\s1 Timothy and Epaphroditus
\p
\v 19 I want to be encouraged by news about you. So I hope the Lord Jesus will soon let me send Timothy to you.
\v 20 I don't have anyone else who cares about you as much as he does.
\v 21 The others think only about what interests them and not about what concerns Christ Jesus.
\v 22 But you know what kind of person Timothy is. He has worked with me like a son in spreading the good news.
\v 23 I hope to send him to you, as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me.
\v 24 And I feel sure that the Lord will also let me come soon.
\p
\v 25 I think I ought to send my dear friend Epaphroditus back to you. He is a follower and a worker and a soldier of the Lord, just as I am. You sent him to look after me,
\v 26 but now he is eager to see you. He is worried, because you heard he was sick.
\v 27 In fact, he was very sick and almost died. But God was kind to him, and also to me, and he kept me from being burdened down with sorrow.
\p
\v 28 Now I am more eager than ever to send Epaphroditus back again. You will be glad to see him, and I won't have to worry any longer.
\v 29 Be sure to give him a cheerful welcome, just as people who serve the Lord deserve.
\v 30 He almost died working for Christ, and he risked his own life to do for me what you could not.
