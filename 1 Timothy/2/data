\s1 How to pray
\p
\v 1 First of all, I ask you to pray for everyone. Ask God to help and bless them all, and tell God how thankful you are for each of them.
\v 2 Pray for kings and others in power, so that we may live quiet and peaceful lives as we worship and honour God.
\v 3 This kind of prayer is good, and it pleases God our Saviour.
\v 4 God wants everyone to be saved and to know the whole truth, which is,
\q1
\v 5 There is only one God,
\q1 and Christ Jesus
\q2 is the only one
\q1 who can bring us
\q2 to God.
\q1 Jesus was truly human,
\q1 and he gave himself
\q2 to rescue all of us.
\q1
\v 6 God showed us this
\q2 at the right time.
\m
\v 7 This is why God chose me to be a preacher and an apostle of the good news. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. God sent me to teach the Gentiles about faith and truth.\x - \xo 2.7: \xt 2 Ti 1.11.\x*
\p
\v 8 I want everyone everywhere to lift innocent hands towards heaven and pray, without being angry or arguing with each other.
\p
\v 9 I would like women to wear modest and sensible clothes. They should not have fancy hair styles, or wear expensive clothes, or put on jewellery made of gold or pearls.\x - \xo 2.9: \xt 1 P 3.3.\x*
\v 10 Women who claim to love God should do helpful things for others,
\v 11 and they should learn by being quiet and paying attention.
\v 12 They should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men what to do.
\v 13 After all, Adam was created before Eve,\x - \xo 2.13: a \xt Gn 2.7; \xo b \xt Gn 2.21,22.\x*
\v 14 and the man Adam wasn't the one who was fooled. It was the woman Eve who was completely fooled and sinned.\x - \xo 2.14: \xt Gn 3.1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved by having children,\f + \fr 2.15 \fq saved by having children: \ft Or “brought safely through childbirth” or “saved by the birth of a child” (that is, by the birth of Jesus) or “saved by being good mothers”.\f* if they stay faithful, loving, holy, and modest.
