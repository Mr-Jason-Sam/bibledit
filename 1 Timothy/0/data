\mt2 Paul's first letter to Timothy
\imt About this letter
\im Timothy travelled and worked with Paul (Romans 16.21; 1 Corinthians 16.10; Philippians 2.19), and because of their shared faith, Timothy was like a son to Paul (1.2). Timothy became one of Paul's most faithful co-workers, and Paul mentions Timothy in five of his letters.
\ip Although this letter is addressed to Timothy personally, it actually addresses many of the concerns Paul had with the life of the entire church. Guidelines are given for choosing church officials (3.1-7), officers (3.8-13), and leaders (5.17-20).
\ip Christians are to pray for everyone and to remember:
\iq There is only one God
\iq and Christ Jesus
\iq2 is the only one
\iq who can bring us
\iq2 to God.
