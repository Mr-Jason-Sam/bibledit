\mt2 Paul's second letter to the church in Thessalonica
\imt About this letter
\im In this letter to the believers in Thessalonica, Paul begins by thanking God that their faith and love keep growing all the time (1.3). They were going through a lot of troubles, but Paul insists that this is God's way of testing their faith, not a way of punishing them (1.4,5).
\ip Someone in Thessalonica claimed to have a letter from Paul, saying that the Lord had already returned (2.2). But Paul warns the church not to be fooled! The Lord will not return until after the “wicked one” has appeared (2.3).
\ip Paul also warns against laziness (3.6-10), and he tells the church to guard against any followers who refuse to obey what he has written in this letter.
\ip The letter closes with a prayer:
\imq I pray that the Lord, who gives peace, will always bless you with peace. May the Lord be with all of you.
\ipr (3.16)
