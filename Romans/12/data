\ms1 How to live the new life of love
\s1 Christ brings new life
\p
\v 1 Dear friends, God is good. So I beg you to offer your bodies to him as a living sacrifice, pure and pleasing. That's the most sensible way to serve God.
\v 2 Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think. Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him.
\p
\v 3 I realize how kind God has been to me, and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are. Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you.
\v 4 A body is made up of many parts, and each of them has its own use.\x - \xo 12.4,5: \xt 1 Co 12.12.\x*
\v 5 That's how it is with us. There are many of us, but we are each part of the body of Christ, as well as part of one another.
\p
\v 6 God has also given each of us different gifts to use. If we can prophesy, we should do it according to the amount of faith we have.\x - \xo 12.6-8: \xt 1 Co 12.4-11.\x*
\v 7 If we can serve others, we should serve. If we can teach, we should teach.
\v 8 If we can encourage others, we should encourage them. If we can give, we should be generous. If we are leaders, we should do our best. If we are good to others, we should do it cheerfully.
\s1 Rules for Christian living
\p
\v 9 Be sincere in your love for others. Hate everything that is evil and hold tight to everything that is good.
\v 10 Love each other as brothers and sisters and honour others more than you do yourself.
\v 11 Never give up. Eagerly follow the Holy Spirit and serve the Lord.
\v 12 Let your hope make you glad. Be patient in time of trouble and never stop praying.
\v 13 Take care of God's needy people and welcome strangers into your home.
\p
\v 14 Ask God to bless everyone who ill-treats you. Ask him to bless them and not to curse them.\x - \xo 12.14: \xt Mt 5.44; Lk 6.28.\x*
\v 15 When others are happy, be happy with them, and when they are sad, be sad.
\v 16 Be friendly with everyone. Don't be proud and feel that you are cleverer than others. Make friends with ordinary people.\fe * \fr 12.16 \fq Make friends with ordinary people: \ft Or “Do ordinary jobs.”\fe*\x - \xo 12.16: \xt Pr 3.7.\x*
\v 17 Don't ill-treat someone who has ill-treated you. But try to earn the respect of others,
\v 18 and do your best to live at peace with everyone.
\p
\v 19 Dear friends, don't try to get even. Let God take revenge. In the Scriptures the Lord says,\x - \xo 12.19: \xt Dt 32.35.\x*
\q1 “I am the one to take revenge
\q2 and pay them back.”
\m
\v 20 The Scriptures also say,\x - \xo 12.20: \xt Pr 25.21,22 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “If your enemies are hungry,
\q2 give them something to eat.
\q1 And if they are thirsty,
\q1 give them something
\q2 to drink.
\q1 This will be the same
\q1 as piling burning coals
\q2 on their heads.”
\m
\v 21 Don't let evil defeat you, but defeat evil with good.
