\v 1 I have good things to say about Phoebe, who is a leader in the church at Cenchreae.

\p
\v 3 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila. They have not only served Christ Jesus together with me,\x - \xo 16.3: \xt Ac 18.2.\x*

\p
\v 16 Be sure to give each other a warm greeting.
\p All Christ's churches greet you.
\p
\v 17 My friends, I beg you to watch out for anyone who causes trouble and divides the church by refusing to do what all of you were taught. Stay away from them!
\v 18 They want to serve themselves and not Christ the Lord. Their flattery and fancy talk fool people who don't know any better.
\v 19 I am glad that everyone knows how well you obey the Lord. But still, I want you to understand what is good and not have anything to do with evil.
\v 20 Then God, who gives peace, will soon crush Satan under your feet. I pray that our Lord Jesus will be kind to you.

\p

\s1 Paul's closing prayer
\p
\v 25 Praise God! He can make you strong by means of my good news, which is the message about\fe * \fr 16.25 \fq about: \ft Or “from”.\fe* Jesus Christ. For many ages this message was kept secret,
\v 26 but now at last it has been told. The eternal God commanded his prophets to write about the good news, so that all nations would obey and have faith.
\v 27 And now, because of Jesus Christ, we can praise the only wise God for ever! Amen.\fe * \fr 16.27 \fq Amen: \ft Some manuscripts have verses 25-27 after 14.23. Others have the verses here and after 14.23, and one manuscript has them after 15.33.\fe*
