Steps: 
* Import BibleWorks into USFM in Bibledit-Web - see Bibledit-Gtk for code.
* Enable or disable the Strong's numbers and other non-USFM code.
* Export to .vpl format - perhaps to map the Bible names.

Simple Bible Reader
Run the Simple_Bible_Reader_vx.xx.exe
If the system says that it is unable to load mscoree.dll, install a recent version of the .NET framework.

e-Sword ToolTip Tool NT
Module Installer


The steps are thus:
Convert BibleWorks to USFM
Convert USFM to USFX:
Download and unzip http://haiola.org/haiola.zip
Install mono-complete 
Run mono usfm2usfx.exe -o output.xml *.usfm
Simple_Bible_Reader_vx.xx.exe converts USFX to BBLX format
This loses the Strong's numbers, unless these are left in the 'USFM' somehow.


Or to ask the programmer of Simple_Bible_Reader for support of BibleWorks files.

Or Ramon can ask around on forums of BibleWorks, eSword, OnlineBible.






bibledit-web: Since send/receive occurs at 12:00, perhaps the 'change'  occur 15 minutes later or so?

Produce, in 'members', and from outside, a searchable version, like the SC manuals.
Steps:
Improve the web version using code from the linked web version.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable parents at the top.
The Bible gets a list of Bible books, clickable.
Each book gets a list of clickable chapters.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable verses.
Every page gets a few anchors: Clickable Logo, Bible name, search entry.
Perhaps to have a switch on the site whether to enable / disable the search functions.
Use sphinxsearch
Crontab starts the search daemon, or ensures that it runs.









Make NDB and SHN Bibles searchable on the site. Version to TBS, and revised version.
