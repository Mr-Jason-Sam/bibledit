Produce, in 'members', and from outside, a searchable version, like the SC manuals.
Steps:
Improve the web version using code from the linked web version.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable parents at the top.
The Bible gets a list of Bible books, clickable.
Each book gets a list of clickable chapters.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable verses.
Every page gets a few anchors: Clickable Logo, Bible name, search entry.
Perhaps to have a switch on the site whether to enable / disable the search functions.
Use sphinxsearch
Crontab starts the search daemon, or ensures that it runs.







Make NDB and SHN Bibles searchable on the site. Version to TBS, and revised version.
