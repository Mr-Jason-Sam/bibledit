The backup folder is /var/lib/bibledit-web/bibledit-web so that parallel instances of Bibledit-Web keep separate backups.
Install the software on bibleconsultants.
Update the scr/copy script so it gets the correct backup.







Backup the demo site.
Note the database and URL it uses, as these currently differ.
Upgrade the demo site.
Test whether it works.






It produces, in 'members', and from outside, a searchable version, very much like the StabiCAD manuals.
That is, it uses sphinxsearch, and it uses parent links and children.









In the web version, when it writes to /tmp, after done, remove the temporal data.
Else the harddisk gets full.
Whether it works can be tested by leaving it overnight, and then to see
the files it leaves in /tmp. There should be really none.
Folder /tmp/ on bibleconsultants was emptied on Sat 7 July 8:30 PM.
Okay, on Monday 9 July there's a lot of stuff in /tmp again.
Probably the daily conversion routines cause this.
To try it out on a local version and to see what happens.
It has been tried, and nothing gets written to /tmp.
So it must be the demo version that needs upgrade.
First try installing bibledit-web in a user-defined location, and fix this option.





Phase the smarty library out, and use Zend forms instead.






git pull teus@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/bibledit.git
git push teus@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/bibledit.git master:master




Perhaps we can find a way to remove the internal mailing software, and instead
use the linux postfix or similar, and then we also can every minute check the local mailbox on Linux.
It implies that a user needs to be created similar to the $location, so it can 
check that email.
