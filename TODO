On top of the site put a search bar.
It searches really everything: Bibles, notes, menus, help: everything.

Settings for sphinxsearch are stored in the database, including the port number, and collapsing data.
The advantage is that the text-based files will not be overwritten after installation.

The search results should be made extremely clear to see:
New lines are displayed as such.
Bible / Book / Chapter / Verse number in green.

Indexing is done in near-realtime. It means that whenever a note changes on the site,
or Bible text, that everything is indexed again.
And when nothing changes, then it indexes the stuff at midnight.
It could use partial indexing if that's available, so that only one chapter or one note needs to be re-indexed.











Provide information about how to create a searchable site, and how to separate the logic from the bibledit-web software.

http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/2.24/

Do not include individual headers: Done.
Do not use deprecated symbols: Done.
Use accessor functions instead of direct access: Done.
Replace GDK_<keyname> with GDK_KEY_<keyname>: Done.















Produce, in 'members', and from outside, a searchable version, like the SC manuals.
Steps:
Improve the web version using code from the linked web version.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable parents at the top.
The Bible gets a list of Bible books, clickable.
Each book gets a list of clickable chapters.
Each chapter gets a list of clickable verses.
Every page gets a few anchors: Clickable Logo, Bible name, search entry.
Perhaps to have a switch on the site whether to enable / disable the search functions.
Use sphinxsearch
Crontab starts the search daemon, or ensures that it runs.









Make NDB and SHN Bibles searchable on the site. Version to TBS, and revised version.








Link the notes in Bibledit-Gtk to the notes in Bibledit-Web:
- No changes to Bibledit-Gtk
- Bibledit-Web accesses the git repository of Bibledit-Gtk's notes.
- bibledit-web gets logic that link the repository to the notes database.
- When doing send/receive on those notes, the output is taken, and processed, and actions taken.







BibleWorks -> eSword options: 
- Expand with html or rtf formatting and notes - this is done per line, not per chapter.
- Add some online help about how it works.
