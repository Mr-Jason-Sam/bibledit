Test installing it in a user-defined location via the ./configure script.
It needs to really install everything somewhere else.





In the web version, when it writes to /tmp, after done, remove the temporal data.
Else the harddisk gets full.
Whether it works can be tested by leaving it overnight, and then to see
the files it leaves in /tmp. There should be really none.
Folder /tmp/ on bibleconsultants was emptied on Sat 7 July 8:30 PM.
Okay, on Monday 9 July there's a lot of stuff in /tmp again.
Probably the daily conversion routines cause this.
To try it out on a local version and to see what happens.
It has been tried, and nothing gets written to /tmp.
So it must be the demo version that needs upgrade.
First try installing bibledit-web in a user-defined location, and fix this option.





Phase the smarty library out, and use Zend forms instead.
