\intro From the verb HQQ, which means to inscribe on a hard surface, or to decree, it refers to an authoritarian decree, or law, most often with the sense of permanence:1. a permanent and binding law, an enduring custom, or a daily task prescribed by God or by a person in authority.3. a fixed and permanent allotment, or provision for designated individuals decreed by God or by a person in authority.4. a person's lot in life as decreed by God, whether it is fate or the fulfilment of a promise.5. the natural order and boundaries of the universe as set by God.7. Decisions, plans, and resolutions.The most frequent context of this word is the Mosaic Law, especially in reference to laws and special allotments for the priests.
\comp All of the senses of XOQ involve 1) the domain of authoritarian action or decree, and 2) the sense of permanence or regularity. In the first sense, the recipient of the XOQ is required to perform certain actions. In the second sense, the beneficiary of the XOQ is the one who receives an allotment that is designated for him specifically. The third and fourth senses consist of an authoritarian action on the part of God that concern the lot of humans (sense 3), and the limits and laws of nature (sense 4). The sense of permanence is re-inforced in a number of instances by the qualifying word 'OLAM (lasting) as in ----, and also in reference to natural boundaries and laws set by God.  When referring to legislation, the term XOQ is used to highlight the permanence of the laws. In the case of prescribed duties for servants (Sense 1, context h), however, the sense of permanence seems to be less prevalent; here XOQ seems to focus more on the sense of a fixed set of tasks for the day.
\dfnotes 1. The feminine form of XOQ, XUQQAH semantically overlaps with XOQ; however there is a different distribution of usage. a. XOQ is found more in reference to non-specified laws, while XUQQAH seems to be preferred in the context of specific laws. However, both terms can be found in both contexts. b. XOQ refers to the permanence of laws, while XUQQAH seems to focus more on the feature of repetition of laws and customs.  Thus, XUQQAH is used more frequently to refer to customs and traditions of other peoples.c. In the context of natural laws, XOQ refers more to the limits and order of nature, while XUQQAH refers to the repetitious acts of nature. 2. See MISHPAT, ''EDUT, MITSWAH, TORAH

\eval Depending on the passage, translations vary: NJPS uses 'law', occasionally 'decree'. NIV, NRSV and others use 'statute', occasionally 'decree', 'regulation', 'rules', etc.. It appears that XOQ does not refer to a particular type of law, but is rather the expression of an aspect of a regulation - that of a binding and permanent prescription. The most generic term for this sense in English is 'law'.

\context A unspecified type of law.  It is often found in a list with other legal terms; in the poetic context it is frequently placed in parallel construction with these same legal terms. While it is difficult to ascertain precise meaning for this word is these contexts, there are nonetheless some interesting patterns. a. frequent pairing with MISHPAT(IM) especially in Deuteronomy and Ezekiel; b. This pairing is, in several passages, associated in a part-whole relationship with TORAH, i.e. XOQ and MISHPATIM are considered to be the primary ingredients of the TORAH, the body of laws given by God through Moses. c. In Psalms 119, the verb LIMED (learn, teach) is more frequently associated with XOQ than with the other legal terms found in the Psalm. See the collocational references below for more patterns. It should be noted that for Psalms 119, I have only noted collocations found in the same verse as XOQ.

\sub חקה ,(חֻקָּה)‏ חֹק
\intro The concrete meaning of |hחקק|h* is : To use a tool to draw, inscribe or carve out on a surface. There are three primary extended meanings :1. To set in place the sky and the foundations of the earth,2. To inscribe in one's memory, and3. To decree a law, or lead a people.The third meaning has futher extended uses:1. A military or political ruler2. A divine lawgiver, i.e. God3. A ruler's staffThis ruler's staff is also used to express the sense of leadership, or headship over a people, as in the ruler's staff being alotted to Judah.
\comp |hחקק|h* carries first and foremost the sense of - to make a permanent mark:1. make a permanent mark on a surface2. make a permanent mark in one's memory3. make a permanent mark in creating the universe The extension into the Legal Frame involves the addition of the authority domain, and can be seen in two ways : 1. Laws and decrees are seen as permanent and binding2. Laws, in the Middle Eastern context were written down, often engraved in stone. Thus it is conceivable that the act of inscribing a law on a surface was extended to mean simply to decree a law. From the sense - to decree a law - the participle form of the verb can have two senses:1. As Agent, meaning lawmaker, or governor2. As a concrete symbol of authority, meaning ruler's staffThe ruler's staff then also becomes a figurative expression meaning leadership. In a very literal sense, then, the participle form of the verb is used to define a leader as an inscriber of laws, and the one who holds the ruler's staff is the one who has the authority to inscribe laws.

\eval Most translations use a subjunctive form - |iOh, that my words were written down |i*(NJPS). This is correct from a grammatical and literary point of view, but it may not be the most natural speech. One translation collapses the parallelism into one statement : |iI wish my words could be written down (CEV)|i*. This is also acceptable, depending on what is considered poetic in the receptor language.

\intro 1. The verb |hצוה|h* is used to express any directive given by anyone in a superior, authority position to anyone under his authority as a means of imposing one's will on the other person and requiring them to do something. This meaning has various translations in English: |icommand, decree, instruct, give orders, tell someone to do something, charge.|i* It is used both in the context of rules and regulations, and laws, as well as in the context of orders for a specific one-time activity. There are also different authority relationships for which the |hצוה|h* may be used: divine-human, kings-subjects, parent-child, master-servant, etc.  When more than one type of relationship is involved between two people, the authority role may change depending on the context. For example, in Esther, Mordecai, as uncle, |icommands|i* Esther not to reveal her origins to anyone (Est .2:20). Later, it is Esther, as queen who |iorders|i* Mordecai to observe a fast (Est.4:17). So though she does not have authority over Mordecai as niece, she does have authority over him as queen, and thus can command him.2. One extension of this basic meaning is : |ito give authority and command|i* another person to do a specific task. One specific example of this is when Moses |icommissioned |i*Joshua to take his position as leader of the Israelites as they enter Canaan. This sense is also used in the context of |igiving final instructions |i*to one's household before dying, as well as |itransmitting a message and/or commands through an intermediary|i*. 3. A second extension of the meaning is used to express God's acts of power and creation. The verb means: |ito decree an event and to make that event happen, i.e. to cause something to happen|i*. Examples of this use can be found in God |icausing |i*acts in all of his creation, the skies, the earth, the animals, and even causing people to act a certain way, especially causing enemies to destroy the Israelites. He can also |icommand|i* blessings, loyalty His covenant, salvation, and victory.|i |i*.
\hebraist (Can TSIVAH mean promise? permit? There are a few contexts where these words are used by certain translations. Something to examine more closely. In these cases, it seems that the context guides the interpretation more than does the basic sense of the word. There are not enough instances that would allow for the validation of this sense. On the other hand, both of these words can be seen as sharing the domain of Authority. See below for more discussion.)

\eval This is a very interesting translation. Instead of literally translating the rhetorical questions and the Hebraic expression |ithe work of my hands|i*, as do almost all other translations (NJPS, NLT, NIV, CEV, REB, NRS - |iWill you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands?|i*),  GNT transforms the sentence into a very powerful exclamation, which correctly interprets the sense of the rhetorical question.

\not (a) One translation uses the word 'promise' here, possibly because the action commanded was seen to be an act of God: ... your servants had heard that the Lord your God had promised His servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all the inhabitants of the country on your account.(NJPS) Other translations have retained the sense of command e.g.: ... Your servants were clearly told how the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land...(NIV).  This rendering, though more literal, is problematic also, because Moses could not have given something he did not have. NET Bible proposes an innovative solution, which seems a little more natural: how the Lord your God commanded Moses his servant to assign you the whole land.

\not (b) These passages are all in the context of Moses passing on the authority of leadership to Joshua. While English translations generally agree that NUM.27:19 and 23 should be translated as 'commission', there is not a consensus for DEU. 3:21, 28; 31:14,23; and JOS. 1:9. A close study of these contexts shows that the sense of investing the authority for leadership is intended. In Numbers, God instructs Moses to commission Joshua in a public ceremony. In Deuteronomy 3, Moses reminds the people of that ceremony, and in Deuteronomy 31, it is God who directly invests the spiritual authority in a private meeting in the Tent of the Meeting, between God, Joshua, and Moses. In the grammatical structure of all these instances, 'Joshua' is always the direct object.

\gloss be successful
\freq 63
\intro Since understanding of how ‘success’ comes about is culturally conditioned, the translation of |hצלח|h* (‘be successful’) is likely to differ from language to language. In some it may be best expressed by the condition for success - ‘ability’ in some way; in others it may be best expressed by the outcome, such as an expression which covers ‘victory’. Since in scripture success (or lack of success) is divinely influenced, and also influenced by moral choices, the words chosen to translate ‘success’ should be able to carry these notions, rather than, for instance, to imply the possession of magical power.The frame of ‘success’ with respect to people requires: (i) a person who experiences or achieves the success; (ii) one of more events in which this person is successful (iii); a measure or way of distinguishing success from failure. While the first of these elements is always expressed in the Hebrew text, the other two may be unexpressed, to be inferred from the context. The extent to which this is acceptable in the language into which translation is being made will have to be determined; one or both of these elements may need to be made more explicit.It is likely that the concept of ‘success’ will need to be translated differently in one or more of the several domains that occur in scripture: Personal Welfare, Warfare (where ‘victory’ may be an appropriate translation), Land/Nation, Venture, God’s Purposes, Justice, Objects (see below). There is some overlapping of these domains (see comments at 5.1, SemanticNetworks.)In the domain of ‘objects’ (which extends ‘success’ beyond the frame used by English speakers), a different word may need to be used to translate ‘success’ than is used for the other domains. This composite domain of ‘objects’ collects together three instances: ‘belt’, ‘vine’ and ‘wood of vine’ (in the NIV and NLT, for instance, ‘thrive’ is used in the context of ‘vine’.)The grammatical subject of the Hebrew verb expressing ‘success’ may be the person or people seeking success, the activity in which success takes place or is being sought (e.g. Num 14:41), or an object used by the person or people seeking success (e.g. Isa 54:17).In scripture, the frame of ‘success’ is found in a positive sub-frame (obeying God results in success, e.g. Jos 1:8), a negative sub-frame (disobeying God results in failure, e.g. Deu 28:29), and in what could be called a contrary sub-frame (evil men sometimes are successful, e.g. Psa 37:7), which gains its force of meaning from the normality of the other two sub-frames.
\hebraist The verb |hצלח|h* may occur either in the qal form or the hiphil form. The hiphil form may or may not have a causative meaning. Whether the hiphil form takes on causative meaning or not is determined by the context.One issue that can be discussed is whether there is a distinction between the qal and the hiphil forms of this verb. Of the 55 usages of this Hebrew verb which refer to ‘success’ in the canonical Old Testament, the qal form is used 15 times and the hiphil form 40 times. Of these 40 uses, in some 30 of these instances the hiphil form is clearly used without causative meaning, that is to say only one agent is expressed; there are only about 10 instances of its use with clear causative meaning, that is to say two agents being expressed, one causing the other to be successful. All instances where the expressed grammatical subject is a thing, that is non-human, involve use of the qal form.One might surmise from this that the qal form is used where the subject is seen as less agentive. In other words that the hiphil form, even when only one agent is involved, is more agentive in some way (that is to say, the agent is seen more as causing himself to be successful.) We have labelled this role as agent/patient since the participant is always involved both in causing his success in some way and in experiencing it. However it does not seem possible to prove whether this distinction of agency (qal = less agentive, hiphil = more agentive, even when not causative) is correct. Western versions do not attempt to make such a distinction in their translations. In languages where degree of agency is marked, such a distinction might appear in translation. However, since the distinction cannot be proven, it is probably best in such languages to read agency out of the context rather than depend on a qal/hiphil distinction which cannot be substantiated.In two cases - Jdg 18:5 and Psa 1:3 - the hiphil form could potentially be analysed as causative (with God as causing agent), or with the activity (‘our road’, ‘all that he does’) as the grammatical subject. A causative analysis does not seem plausible in either case. In the first case the verb is clearly marked as having a feminine subject. In both cases (as additional evidence) the Septuagint translators understood the activity to be the subject.
\altint With respect to the plural verb ‘success’ in Jer 5:28, one question concerns who should be taken as the grammatical subject, whether the ‘wicked men’ of verse 26 or the ‘fatherless’ of this verse. Most modern translations render the clause as a purpose clause (c.f. Waltke and O’Connor 1990:650.) If the subject is taken as ‘wicked men’ it could be rendered (RSV) ‘they [wicked men] judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper’, or (NIV) ‘they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it’. If the subject is taken as the ‘fatherless’ it could be rendered: ‘that they [the fatherless] may have success’.Tawil (Tawil 1976) argues from a related language that the verb in this context should be understood as ‘provide/render justice’ and, claiming implicit negation from the context, translates the verse (with ‘wicked men’ as subject): ‘they judge not the cause, the cause of the orphan they do not justly render’.Although these three interpretations differ in detail, they are concordant as regards the resultant meaning. Tawil’s interpretation is more radical, since it involves the detail of an extended meaning for |hצלח|h* (‘provide/render justice’) and the need to adopt an implied negative; the resultant meaning in the context of the preceding and following clause is, nevertheless, the same.A fourth more literal possibility is represented by the Segond Révisé translation, but is more disjointed: ‘ils ne défendent pas la cause, la cause de l'orphelin, et ils prospèrent; ils ne font pas droit aux pauvres’/’they do not defend the cause, the cause of the orphan, and they prosper; they do not defend the right of the poor’. This disjointedness suggests that an original speaker/hearer would have understood the expression in a more meaningful way, however we lack sufficient access to original speaker/hearer knowledge to know what that would have been.If a grammatical subject or object has to be supplied, a compromise is to use ‘cause/case’ as the subject or object and render the clause as a purpose clause, as in the first two options presented above.
\dfnotes The domains of success that appear in Scripture overlap to some extent. The personal success or welfare of the king, for instance, will affect the welfare of the land or nation.The frame of ‘success’ requires: (i) a person (or, in the Hebrew frame, a thing) who achieves and experiences the success; (ii) one of more events in which this person is successful (iii); a measure or way of distinguishing success from failure. (This last could also be thought of as the ideal version of (ii), that is to say a successful version of the event or events.) The first of these elements will be expressed in the Hebrew text, but the other two may be unexpressed, to be inferred from the context. The extent to which this is acceptable in the language into which translation is being done will have to be determined; one or both of these elements may need to be made more explicit. There may also be other participants, specifically agents; such as a ‘causing agent’ who causes the events to be successful (always Divine); and in one case (Jer 2:37) a ‘secondary’ or ‘helping agent’.In scripture, the frame of ‘success’ is found in a positive form (obeying God results in success, e.g. Jos 1:8), a negative form (disobeying God results in failure, e.g. Deu 28:29), and in what could be called a contrary form (evil men are sometimes successful, e.g. Psa 37:7), which gains its force of its meaning from the normality of the other two forms.The inclusion of objects in the frame of ‘successfulness’ for the Hebrew language means that this frame is conceptually larger than the corresponding frame in English. It includes notions of ‘effectiveness’ and ‘productiveness’ (and these could be considered supplementary names for this frame.)

\not (a) Unusually, the target and the agent of the stimulus are different.
\not (b) Text critical, exegetical and hermeneutical questions abound in this verse. KTBH takes the view that |hבַּר|h*, although apparently Aramaic rather than Hebrew, does mean 'son' and is coreferential with 'my son' of v. 7. The psalm is taken to be a coronation hymn, in which David or the Davidic king is presented as being adopted by Yahweh (v. 7). The surrounding nations are envisaged as being in the rebellion against the king and refusing to kiss him, that is to pay homage to him.Alternative suggestions are based on change of vowels, change of consonants or redivision of vv. 11-12. For a discussion see Bratcher and Reyburn (UBS 1991), who reject the interpretation given here, and Craigie (WBC 1983) who defends it, noting that 'the use of |hבר|h* here avoids the dissonance of |hבן פן|h*'.A further question is whether the son in view is the Messiah, and thus whether 'Son' should be capitalised. In the original context of the psalm, the referent was probably the then King of Israel or Judah, and the psalm was not overtly prophetic, so the Experiencer was human and 'son' should probably not be capitalised.

\intro 1. There are two Hebrew words with the same form. One of them is a noun meaning either ‘anger’ or ‘nose, nostril, face’. The other is a particle meaning ‘also, even, indeed’.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b. 3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist There is unanimous agreement that the particle |hאַף|h* and the noun are homonyms (BDB, HALOT, DCH, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT). Equally there is agreement that the two meanings of the noun, 'nose, nostril' and 'anger', are related. The original meaning of the root |hאנף|h* and the precise nature of the relationship between the meanings of |hאַף|h*, however, are less certain.In some cases, the connection becomes explicit where other Hebrew words for 'anger' collocate with |hאַף|h* used in the sense 'nose'. TDOT cites, Ezk 38:18 and Psa 18:8-9, noting that 'in the OT the nose plays a certain role in the description of anger' (1.351). Similarly in Isa 65:5, 'these people are smoke in my nose' implying that they are a source of irritation and anger.One suggestion is that |hאנף|h* may originally have meant 'to snort' and thus form a link between 'nose' and 'anger' but this is not universally accepted (TDOT 1.351).

\dfnotes For notes see other synonyms. In addition:It may be helpful to distinguish positive and negative frames for divine anger:For the positive frame, the domain related to the stimulus event is apostasy, and that related to the consequence frame is judgement.For the negative frame 'turning from anger' the domain related to the stimulus event is repentance, and that related to the consequence frame is mercy.The negative frame is often expressed by a construction with |hשׁוב|h*, either with the verb in the Qal and |hאַף|h* as subject, often with a |hמִן|h* phrase of the former target, (x18), or with the verb in the Hiphil and God as subject (x5).Alternatively, it may be expressed by the Hiphil of |hנוח|h* with |hחֵמָה|h* as object, 'God gave rest to his anger'.

\eval Most translations use two of the available English synonyms for the two Hebrew synonyms in the parallelism - 'anger, wrath' (NIV), 'anger, fury' (TEV), 'anger, rage' (NJB, NJV) or 'wrath, fury' (RSV, NRS). These are all good models, though, perhaps, since |hאַף|h* is the most common of the Hebrew synonyms, and 'anger' is the most common in English, 'anger' might be the best choice. REB renders the prepositional phrase 'in his anger' by the adverb 'angrily' which may also be followed.

\keyverse Refrain from |banger |b*and forsake wrath, ... (KTBH)
\eval Most translations render |hאַף|h* by 'anger' and use another of the available English synonyms for |hחֵמָה|h* in the parallel colon - 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS), 'anger, fury' (NJV), 'anger, rage' (NJB) or 'wrath, fury' (RSV, NRS). These are all good models, especially since |hאַף|h* is the most common of the Hebrew synonyms, and 'anger' is the most common in English. REB, 'be angry no more' and CEV, 'don't be angry' transform the noun into a predicative adjective. This may be appropriate in some languages. TEV, 'don't give in to ... anger' conflates the two Hebrew synonyms into one, 'anger', which may be appropriate if parallelism is being removed consistently.

\not (a) Unusually, the target is more extensive than the agent of the stimulus, suggesting corporate culpability.
\not (b) Most consider this to refer to God's anger, but Reyburn notes that the phrase 'in his anger' or 'by his nostril' may suggest the picture of a hot blast of breath through the nostril (UBS 1992).
\not (c) If |hמִקְנֶה|h* with the sense 'cattle' is retained, then |hאַף|h* is probably the particle rather than the noun. However, the Targum appears to have understood |hמִקְנֶה|h* as derived from the verb |hקנא|h*  'to be jealous', so a translation 'the wrath of indignation' is possible (Hartley, NICOT 1988, 477 n.17). Both HALOT and BDB recommend repointing as the Hiphil participle |hמַקְנֶה|h*. For other possible emendations of this difficult verse, see Pope (AB 1965, 238).
\not (d) Several Hebrew mss, supported by LXX and Tg, read |hחֶרֶב|h* 'sword' for |hחָרֹון|h* 'burning [anger]', in which case there is no collocating synonym. See |hחָרֹון|h*.
\not (e) Presumably an expression of anger or other emotion.
\not (f) |hרוּחַ אַפֹּו|h* should probably be translated as an anthropomorphism, 'the breath of his nose/nostrils' even though God's anger is also in the background.
\not (g) The idiom here, if indeed the text is correct, is unclear. LXX appears to have read |hאפס|h* for |hאפים|h*, '... although he loved Hannah ...'. Klein follows this reading (WBC, 1983). The Peshitta understood the phrase |hמָנָה אַחַת אפַּיִם|h* to mean 'a double portion', perhaps on the basis of the dual form. This understanding has been defended by KD on the grounds of a shift from |hאַף|h* to  'face' to 'person' and since it is dual, one portion for two persons. This has been followed by NIV and NRS. Other emendations have been proposed, see AB and UBS.Whatever reading is accepted, anger is not in view.
\not (h) The sense here is of smoke in (or 'from' see Anderson, WBC on 2Sa 22:9) God's nose, though his anger is also in view, as the preceding verse shows.

\intro 1. The verb means ‘to speak in anger’ or ‘to curse’, while the noun from the same root focuses mostly on the anger, itself.2. The only distinction in meaning is between God speaking in anger to someone, Meaning 1a, and someone God speaking in anger to someone else, Meaning 1b. 3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist The relationship between this noun and its cognate verb requires specific comment. The noun collocates frequently with words for 'anger', whereas the verb does not. In Num 23:7-8 and Pro 24:24, the verb collocates instead with words meaning 'to curse'. The relationship then may be that, for the verb, the meaning shifts from 'to be angry' > 'to speak in anger' > 'to curse', whereas for the noun, the meaning 'anger' dominates. Most instances of the verb and the noun, though not all, fit this pattern.

\eval There is considerable variation in rendering of the phrase |hזַעַם לְשֹׁונָם|h* because translators differ in their understanding of the precise nuance of |hזַעַם|h*: 'insolence' (NIV, RSV), 'arrogance' (TEV, NJB), 'anger' (REB), 'rage' (NRS), 'folly' (CEV) or 'stammering' (NJV). Apart from the last, all would fit the context, but the root |hזעם|h* points in the direction of speech arising from anger.

\not (a) The collocation with |hשָׂפָה|h* and |hלָשֹׁון|h* suggests that there may be a nuance of 'speaking in anger' rather than just anger, but the 'burning anger' and the 'consuming fire' suggest that anger predominates.
\not (b) Even though Jeremiah is the actual Experiencer, he is sharing in Yahweh's anger, cf Jer 6:11 'I am full of the anger of Yahweh'.
\not (c) The association with |hלָשֹׁון|h* and the occurrence of |hלַעַג|h* in the next clause suggests speech, probably in anger, against God or his prophets. Angry speech is also more consistent with the main use of the verb for cursing.

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone being in less than normal physical or emotional health, and showing it, Meaning 3.2. The one instance of Meaning 2 is like Meaning 1, but refers to the violence of the sea, behaving as if it were angry.
\hebraist Most of the instances of |hזעף|h* and its cognates occur in contexts where the meaning 'anger' is appropriate. A few, particularly Gen 40:6 and Dan 1:10, cannot have that meaning, leading some to propose two homonyms. |hזעף|h* I 'to rage, be angry' is well attested in cognate languages, but the existence of |hזעף|h* II is debated. HALOT, TDOT and NIDOTTE all defend homonym II by citing an Arabic root|i ḍaʿif|i* 'look wretched, pitiful, dejected' though TDOT notes that |iḍ |i*does not correspond to Hebrew |hז|h*.BDB maintains a single root with a central meaning 'be out of humour' which develops in two directions 'be dejected' and 'be enraged' corresponding to the two main meanings presented here.

Others recognise that the raging is a property of the sea and translate 'the raging sea' (NIV), the raging of the sea' (REB). 'Rage' is a good rendering because the English and Hebrew match, though this may not be possible in other languages. TEV conveys the meaning without the word 'rage': '[the sea] calmed down' (CEV similar). Depending on translation style, any of these would be a good model to follow.

\altint The majority view (HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE) is that the adjective is derived from |hזעף|h* I and has the sense 'angry'. It is worth noting, however, that |hזעף|h* II, with the sense 'out of humour, dejected' would also fit.

\intro 1. Most instances of the word refer to anger or to the heat of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.4. In a few instances, the word has other meanings, perhaps related to heat. One is ‘poison, venom’, Meaning 2a, and another is fever from wine, Meaning 2b.
\hebraist |hחֵמָה|h* is generally agreed to be derived from |hיחם|h*, though |hחמם|h* and |hיחם|h* are closely associated roots and there is even some doubt over which of the two roots gives rise to some of the Qal forms.|hחמם|h* means 'to be hot' in various senses, and |hיחם|h* also means 'to be' hot', but in a more limited sexual and reproductive sense. This sexual and reproductive sense, however, is not attested for |hחֵמָה|h*. Its most common sense is 'anger', though it occurs a few times in the senses 'poison, venom' and 'fever'. As TDOT notes, 'the notion of "being hot" ... probably furnishes the point of departure for all three meanings'.

\keyverse O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your |bwrath|b*. (NIV)
\eval A problem here is the two words for 'anger' in the parallel cola. Most use two English synonyms: 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB), 'anger, fury' (NJV) or 'anger, heat of wrath' (NJB). Use of the neutral 'anger' for the common |hאַף|h* is natural, but care is necessary for the other word to avoid wrong connotations. 'Wrath' is old-fashioned and used only for God's wrath. For this reason, it may be the best choice. 'Fury' conveys intensity and is appropriate for a temporary anger, which is not a settled attitude. [Murray asks - is this our job?]CEV collapses the parallel cola and needs only one word 'anger'; in this this case, this does not lead to loss of meaning.

NICOT accepts this as the simplest way to make sense of the text, but WBC retains MT and translates the colon 'for [yours is] an anger worthy of the sword'.If MT is retained, the anger is probably divine and the verse should be understood, 'for wrath will bring punishment by the sword' (NIV).
\not (b) There is a minority view (REB, TDOT) which sees this as an instance of the '[heat of] wine', probably under the influence of Driver (cited by Watts, WBC). Watts (WBC), Oswalt (NICOT) and Young all reject this meaning and take |hחֵמָה|h* to have its normal meaning 'anger'.
\not (c) Even though Jeremiah is the actual Experiencer, he is sharing in Yahweh's anger, cf Jer 15:17 'you filled me with anger'.
\not (d) 'Anger' is difficult in this context. Many either delete or emend eg NICOT. If MT is retained, NRS is a good model to follow, 'Beware that wrath does not entice you into scoffing', though 'anger' might be better than 'wrath' unless God's anger is in view.
\not (e) There is considerable ambiguity here. For fuller discussion see NICOT. KTBH retains MT, follows HALOT in reading the noun |hחֵמָה|h* rather than |hחֵמֶת|h*, understands |hחֵמָה|h* in its normal sense 'anger' and takes the Experiencer as the addressee, the Babylonians.

When the word means ‘anger’, There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.4.

\hebraist Other ANE languages have a cognate root which has the meaning 'to burn' in a literal sense. This suggests that the literal meaning may also have been present in Hebrew, but in the HB the root only occurs in metaphorical senses, particularly 'to burn with anger'. It does however, collocate with literal fire, both in narrative (Num 11:1) and in poetry (2Sa 22:8-9, Psa 18:8-9).Other verbs |hעבר|h* 'to burn' (Psa 2:12, Isa 30.27) and |hעשׁן|h* 'to smoke' (Deu 29:19, Psa 74:1) also take |hאַף|h* (and other words for anger) as subject, though less often than |hחרה|h* and their literal meaning is more prominent.  |hחרה|h* is unique, however, in that the literal sense is unattested.Of the two main constructions of the Qal,|na|n* one makes the anger explicit, 'someone's anger burned', and the other is an impersonal construction in which the anger is implicit, 'it burned to someone' = 'someone was angry'. The latter construction is also attested in Hebrew for other emotions.|nb|n* There appears, however, to be little or no difference between the two constructions. The fuller expression is used for most instances of Yahweh's anger, but not consistently. The shorter expression is more common for human anger, but both occur.
\evalev HALOT proposes a second homonym, attested only at Isa 24:6. The Westminster Hebrew Institute, in their morphological database, however, follow the majority of authorities (BDB, NIDOTTE, gkc, Even-Shoshan) against HALOT and considers the form |hחָרוּ|h*, found at Isa 24:6, to be derived from the root |hחרר|h*.

\dfnotes See other synonyms for notes. In addition:1. 'Then David was angry because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzzah' (2Sa 6:8, NIV, similarly REB) is an informative mistranslation. The Hebrew makes Yahweh the subject of the verb |hפרץ|h*, but NIV makes Yahweh's anger into the subject, thereby demoting Yahweh in terms of the actor-undergoer hierarchy, and presenting him as being driven by his own anger. Others follow Hebrew more closely, making Yahweh the agent of the 'breaking out'.2. It is the event-type of the associated events that determines the domains involved. For example, for divine anger, the stimulus is typically apostasy and the consequence is judgement.

\not (a) A third construction with |hבְּעֵינֵי|h* also occurs, but only twice, both times in Genesis (31:35; 45:5) and both negated.
\not (b) Joüon and Muraoka note that impersonal constructions with |hל|h* occur with a 3ms verb, especially when they express an emotion. |hחָרָה לֹו|h* 'he is angry', |hחַם לֹו|h* 'he is hot', |hצַר לֹו|h* 'he is distressed', |hמַר לֹו|h* 'he is unhappy' and others (§152.d). See also gkc §144.b and ibhs §22.7.b.
\not (c) There are only three instances of the Niphal of |hחרה|h*. They show a different syntax in that the Experiencer is subject, but the target is still introduced by |hבּ|h*. Some commentators attribute reflexive significance to the Niphal form: thus KD renders it by 'burn inwardly' at Sng 1:6 and TOTC by 'keep themselves incensed' at Isa 45:24, but there is insufficient evidence to support a distinct meaning. Thus KTBH includes the Niphal with the more common Qal.BHS proposes repointing both instances of the Niphal in Isaiah as a form of |hנחר|h* 'snort [with indignation]' but this is 'unnecessary here, since MT is neither impossible nor improbable' (NICOT on 41:11).
\not (d) In Job 19:11, MT points as the Hiphil, but BHS and HALOT recommend repointing as the Qal. If MT is retained, the construction with the Hiphil may either be the same as the impersonal construction with the Qal, with |hאַפֹּו|h* as subject 'his anger burned', or there may be a causative nuance, 'he has kindled his anger', with |hאַפֹּו|h* as object.
\not (e) At Deu 29:26, the target is 'that land' but by metonymy it refers to the people of the land, the Egyptians
\not (f) Unusually, the target is more extensive than the agent of the stimulus.
\not (g) The syntax of Hab 3:8 seems to be unique. If MT is accepted, then |hיהוה|h* must be either the personal subject of |hחרה|h* or a vocative with elision of the |hלְךָ|h* normally expected with |hחרה|h*. Most commentaries and translations assume the latter, except for Robertson (NICOT 1990, 229) who appears to assume the former without comment. For detailed discussion, including defence of MT, see Andersen (AB 2001, 316-17).
\not (h) In this instance, self-anger is probably implied, which is rare in HB. The same construction, with |hבְּעֵנֵי|h*, occurs at Gen 31:35 but there Experiencer and Target are distinct.
\not (i) This may be an unusual instance of an inanimate target, but it is more likely that |hעַל|h* expresses the stimulus, 'about the plant', as the translations all agree and Price and Nida make explicit, 'It is important not to imply that Jonah was angry at the plant itself but because the plant had withered and died' (UBS).
\not (j) This gloss is taken from BDB. HALOT and BHS both recommend emendation to some form of |hיחל|h* 'to wait'. The normal meaning of the Hithpolel of |hחיל|h* hardly fits the context: 'to writhe with fear (HALOT) or 'to whirl, writhe' (BDB).
\not (k) This word appears to be a Hiphil form from |hחרה|h*, but it is difficult to assign a meaning to such a form in this context. The word is absent from LXX, probably either because it was missing from their |iVorlage |i*or because they did not understand it either. Those who retain MT generally translate 'eagerly, zealously' or the like, but, as Williamson notes, 'this is not a legitimate meaning of this word' (WBC). NICOT translates in brackets and WBC and AB omit. In the context of the present work in KTBH, the sense 'anger' is absent.

\intro 1. All but one instance of the word refers to the burning of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word refers to ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b. 3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.4. In Psa 58:10, the meaning is very uncertain, Meaning 2.
\hebraist For discussion of the likely original sense 'burning' of the root see the cognate verb |hחרה|h*. Although the term is never used of literal burning,|na|n* it is used in contexts in which literal burning is a consequence of God's anger (eg Lam 4:11).In a similar manner to the verb, there are two constructions, the more common in which |hאַף|h* 'anger' is explicit, God's |hחֲרֹון אַף|h*, and the less common in which it is implicit, God's |hחָרֹון|h*. There appears to be little or no difference in meaning between the two constructions.

\not (c) Only here in the plural. Tate takes it as an intensive or plural of amplification, citing gkc 124.e (WBC 1990). BDB suggests 'bursts of burning anger' probably assuming a plural of intensity.
\not (d) This assumes that the 3ms suffix refers to Yahweh (cf the similar phrase in v. 37) and not |hהַיֹּונָה|h*, understood as 'the oppressor'. However the commentaries handle the difficulties of the preceding colon, they agree that it is the anger of Yahweh that is in view.
\not (e) The Experiencer is ambiguous in this verse, but essentially the same phrase, differing only in an explicit 1cs suffix, refers to Yahweh's anger in v. 14, so that is likely to be the case in v. 12 too. There is, however, textual uncertainty in the sequence  |hחָרֹון|h* (v. 12), |hחָזֹון|h* (v. 13) and |hחֲרֹונִי|h* (v. 14), which looks suspicious and is missing from LXX. See Allen (WBC 1994).
\not (f) This assignment makes two assumptions:1) MT is correct, though several Hebrew mss, supported by LXX and Tg, read |hחֶרֶב|h* 'sword' for |hחָרֹון|h* 'burning [anger]' and2) the following genitive |hהַיֹּונָה|h* should be understood as 'the oppressor'.A good case can be made for accepting an emendation based on LXX if |hחָרֹון|h* was read by dittography from the colon that follows. Most translations and commentaries do so.If MT is retained, the next word |hהַיֹּונָה |h*is generally understood either as 'oppressor(s)' though it may also be an abstract noun 'oppression' (WBC).
\not (g) The meaning of v. 10, especially the second half is very uncertain. See, for example, Tate (WBC 1990). KTBH shares the view of Bratcher and Reyburn that, 'It would be of little practical use to list the many ways in which the text has been handled. No two translations agree completely, and all (including even NIV) have textual footnotes. Whatever course a translator takes, a note should indicate that the Hebrew makes little sense' (UBS, 1991).

\eval Some translations take the construct pair |hחְָרִי אַף|h* as an intensifying construction and use an adjective 'fierce anger' (NIV, RSV, NRS, NJB) or 'blazing anger' (REB). The imagery of the Hebrew idiom 'burning anger' works well in English and may be followed in other languages if they use similar imagery. Other translations conflate the two words into one eg anger (TEV) or raging (NJV), and this may also be followed.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b. 3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.4. Meaning 3 is distinguished in Ezk 32:9, where the response in view is fear or horror. Elsewhere it is anger.
\hebraist 1. The two instances of the Piel both collocate closely with the Hiphil. Either they describe the same sequence of events (1Sa 1:6-7) or they connect two similar events (a cause and its effect; Deu 32:21). Both stems signal a causative meaning. The distinction is stylistic, not semantic (TDOT: 'the very rare piel appears to represent a stylistically motivated variant to a nearby hiphil').2. The cognate noun (see |hכַּעַס|h*) collocates with the verb, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction eg |hבְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה |h*‘because of the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).3. The majority of instances of this root are spelled with a |hס|h*, but in the book of Job, it is spelled consistently with |hשׂ|h*. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. TDOT and NIDOTTE suggest that the spelling with |hשׂ |h*may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate.
\comp 1 Stem: Qal; agent: null; experiencer: subject; target: human; focus: response; response: anger	1a Experiencer: God	1b Experiencer: human2 Stem: Piel and Hiphil; agent: subject; experiencer: object; target: = agent; focus: provocation; response: anger	2a Agent: human; experiencer: God	2b Agent: God or human; experiencer: human3 Stem: Hiphil; agent: subject; experiencer: object; focus: provocation; response: fear or horror: frame: horror	3a Agent: God; experiencer: human
\dfnotes With one exception (Ezk 32:9) the meanings of |hכעס|h* all relate to the same frame, labelled simply ‘anger’ in which the elements are: 	the anger event itself	an experiencer of the anger	an event which is the stimulus for the anger	an agent who instigates that event and may be described as the agent which causes the anger	a target of the anger who is normally the same as the agent	consequence event(s) of the anger having an impact on the targetMeaning 1 points to the anger event itself, while for Meaning 2 the focus is the event which is the stimulus for the anger.Subsequent research might show that it would be better to deal with two sub-frames, divine anger and human anger, which would relate to different domains in different ways. Alternatively, since, at least some of the time, the anger of a man of God is expected to match that of God, the sub-frames might be righteous and unrighteous anger.Perhaps because anger is such a common human experience, the anger frame is evoked in many contexts so that the frame is understood against a background of many domains. Thus there are no core domains, only non-core. For example:	Wickedness: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Idolatry: God's anger is provoked by idolatry	Injustice: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Unbelief: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the unbelief of Israel in the wilderness	Prophecy: a prophet provoked the anger of an ungodly king	Judgement: God's anger against the target was expected to have punishment as a consequence
\addinfo 1. With only one exception (Ezk 32:9), all the instances of the verb describe anger as the response to a stimulus. Although this instance is unique for the verb, the cognate noun (see |hכַּעַס|h*) does have a wider semantic range and refers to several responses other than anger (cf TDOT).

\eval It is important to distinguish the response from anger. Most translations appropriately use a generic translation, eg 'I will trouble' (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV) or 'I shall cause disquiet' (REB). CEV's 'nations will be shocked' may capture more precisely the nature of the response which God provokes, as indicated in v. 10. However, its use of a passive, perhaps for stylistic reasons, reduces the force of nineteen first person singular verbs in twelve verses in the Hebrew, which emphasise what Yahweh will do. NJV's use of ‘vex’ (its normal equivalent for |hכעס|h*) implies anger, which is out of place here. Similarly, 'grieve' (NJB) slightly misreads the response.

\not (a) In the eyes of the wicked, godliness provokes anger.
\not (b) The ancient versions (LXX, Syr, Tg, Vul) appear to have read the noun |hוְכַעַס|h* for the verb |hוְכָעַס|h* of the MT, from which it differs by only one vowel. If this is accepted and the |hבְּ|h* prefixed to |hחֹשֶׁךְ|h* is taken to govern the whole string of coordinated nouns, the verse reads more smoothly, ‘All his days he eats in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger.’ (NIV). This emendation is widely adopted by modern versions and is accepted by Murphy (WBC), Longman (NICOT), Seow (AB) and Ogden and Zogbo (UBS).If this emendation of the verb to the noun is adopted, this instance, in its context in Ecclesiastes, should be seen as an example of |hכַּעַס|h*, Use 1d, and rendered ‘frustration’.A second emendation, which should also be considered, is adopted by NIV, above, and most others, based on the ancient versions (LXX, Syr, Tg, Vul) which appear to have read |hוְחָלְיוֹ|h* as |hוָחְָלִי|h* without the pronominal suffix. The |hו|h*-suffix may have arisen by dittography.RSV and some others, but not NRS, adopt a third emendation, based on LXX, alone, which appears to have read |hוָאֵבֶל|h*  ‘and grief’ for |hיֹאכֵל|h* ‘he eats’. This is a plausible emendation, but MT is the harder reading and makes good sense. Furthermore, ‘eating and drinking’ (as in v. 17) are among Qoheleth’s highest hopes. Few modern versions adopt this emendation and, among commentators surveyed, only Ogden and Zogbo (UBS) accept it.
\not (c) Presumably an expression of anger or other emotion.
\not (d) Even where the stimulus is an object, it is an idol and thus associated with an idolatry event.
\not (e) Probably.Following Williamson (WBC, 1985:214, 217) and some modern translations (eg NLT, ESV, RSV), KTBH assigns Nehemiah 3:37 to Use 2a and recommends making God the explicit Experiencer whose anger is being provoked. Fensham (NICOT), TDOT and other modern translations (eg NIV, NRS, NJV, NJB, NAB and REB), however, interpret the preposition in |hלְנֶגֶד הַבּוֹנִים |h*'in front of the builders' as signalling the people provoked rather than the witnesses of the provocation. Although TDOT favours God as the implied Experiencer for each of five other instances listed below, it rejects this interpretation in the case of Nehemiah 3:37. Evidence for this view includes Sanballat's ridicule of the Jews (v. 33), which may point to the 'builders' as the Experiencers (Use 2b). Arguments against this position include:1. It would involve a unique use of this preposition and Williamson (WBC, 1985:214) sees this as 'an insuperable difficulty'. 2. In five other instances God is the implied, but unexpressed, Experiencer of the Hiphil of |hכעס|h* (1Ki 21:22; 2Ki 21:6; 2Ki 23:19; Hos 12:15; Psa 106:29). 3. Nehemiah's request earlier in the same verse 'do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from before you' may imply some offence against God, which would provoke His anger.A third possibility (not followed in any translation) may be indicated by the context of the previous few verses (33-36), where it was Nehemiah and his associates who were being provoked (in the hearing of the builders).
\not (f) In the relationship between Hannah and Peninnah, Hannah’s emotional response would have been complex and mixed, but is likely to have included both anger and grief. There would have been grief and sadness because of her childlessness, but the story at this point is emphasising the antagonism between Elkanah’s two wives, so anger would be prominent. Either, or a mixture of both, would account for the weeping of v. 7. KTBH has classified this as ‘anger’ but if there is a non-committal translation equivalent, such as the English ‘provoke’, it may be wise to use it.
\not (g) Possibly.
\not (h) Only in Ezekiel 32:9 is the 'anger' frame precluded by the context. The parallel use of the verbs in v. 10 (see Similar Terms) signals a different meaning such as 'to disturb' (HALOT) or 'to agitate'. TDOT similarly distinguishes Ezekiel 32:9 by noting its association with trembling. BDB, however, does not make this distinction and gives the gloss 'vex, provoke to anger'.
\not (i) There are insufficient data to conclude that a human cannot be the agent in this Meaning.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between the anger, grief etc which someone experiences, Meaning 1, and what causes someone to experience the anger etc, Meaning 2.2. Another distinction which requires care in translation is the nature of the response. The noun has a wider range of meaning than the corresponding verb (see |hכעס|h*). It is used for responses which include grief, Meaning 1c, and frustration, Meaning 1d, as well as anger, Meanings 1a and 1b. Sometimes it may be wise to translate with a neutral word like the English ‘provocation’.3. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b.4. When the response is anger, it is important to remember that God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*) collocates with the noun, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction e.g.|hבְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה|h* ‘with the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf. 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).2. The majority of instances of the root are spelled with a |hס|h*, but in the book of Job, the spelling is consistently with |hשׂ|h*. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. It is suggested that the spelling with |hשׂ|h* may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate (TDOT, NIDOTTE) or that it is a dialectal variation (BDB, TWOT).3. Unlike the cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*), the participants are, for the most part, not closely linked syntactically to the head word. Some are vague, especially in the Wisdom literature (see below), but generally they can be recovered from the wider context and a knowledge of the frame involved.
\comp 1 Focus: response	1a Experiencer: God; response: anger; target: human	1b Experiencer: human; response: anger; target: human	1c Experiencer: human; response: grief; target: none	1d Experiencer: human; response: frustration; target: futility2 Focus: provocation	2a Experiencer: God; response: anger	2b Experiencer: human; response: anger
\dfnotes For notes on the ‘anger’ frame, see this section in the entry for the cognate verb.The Contextual Uses of Meaning 1 are closely related since anger, grief and frustration are closely related experiences. The additional frame listed is, in each case, a sub-frame of the more generic 'stimulus - negative response' frame. The main points of distinction between the sub-frames concern the nature of the emotions and the reactions they cause, but they may also be distinguished on the basis of differences in participant roles.The ‘grief’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by the absence of a target. Otherwise, the corresponding elements are present:	the grief event itself	an experiencer of the grief	an event which is the stimulus for the grief	an agent who instigates that event	a consequence event - weeping etcThe ‘frustration’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by an impersonal instrument causing the frustration and absence of an agent 	the frustration event itself	an experiencer of the frustration	an event which is the target for the frustration - in Ecclesiastes it is the futility of life and toil. In the causing event, this is an abstract instrument rather than a personal agent.
\addinfo 1. Unlike the cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*) for which the response to a stimulus is almost always anger, |hכַּעַס|h* has a wider semantic range and is used for various responses other than anger (cf TDOT).2. The Wisdom writings sometimes leave participants unexpressed and very general (eg the target in Ecc 7:9 and the experiencer in Pro 27:3). It is the knowledge of the 'anger' frame that enables the reader to recognise that there must be an experiencer and a target in each case.

\eval Most translate by 'grief' (RSV, NRS, REB) or 'sorrow' (NIV, CEV). This seems appropriate because the effect on the psalmist's eyes is likely to be from weeping. The use of 'vexation' by NJV and NJB points to anger rather than grief, so should be avoided. TEV ‘I can hardly see; my eyes are so swollen from the weeping caused by my enemies’ makes the weeping explicit and points unambiguously to grief, though it does not have a direct equivalent to |hכַּעַס|h*.

Others, such as 'sorrow' (NIV), 'worries' (TEV) and 'grief' (NJB) seem further from the point.

\keyverse Yahweh saw this and he rejected them because of the |bprovocation |b*of his sons and his daughters. (KTBH)
\eval RSV 'because of the provocation of his sons' retains a noun 'provocation' which in English generally implies provocation to anger and thus is satisfactory. A subjective genitive ‘provocation by his sons' would be readily understood. Other translations transform the noun into a verb and thereby convey the same meaning eg 'because he was angered by his sons and daughters' (NIV). Several translations reconstruct the verse to achieve a smoother reading eg NRS, 'The LORD saw it, and was jealous; he spurned his sons and daughters.' It is not clear, however, whether this is a decision to follow the emendation proposed in BHS or whether it is a matter of translation technique.

\not (a) This usage is unique to Ecclesiastes (1:18; 2:23; 11:10 and also 5:16, if the emendation of the verb to the noun is accepted - see |hכעס|h* note b). Neither BDB nor HALOT distinguishes this sense, but both list these instances under the same sense as others outside Ecclesiastes which have the sense of ‘grief’. The context, however, does not permit the sense ‘anger’ and, while ‘grief’ is close, it is not quite right. The collocation with |hעָמָל|h*  and |hעִנְיָן|h*, other key terms in Ecclesiastes, indicates a more specific sense for the word. A major, if not the major, theme of the book is the futility of life, wisdom and work; everything is meaningless (for further discussion see |hהֶבֶל|h*). The English ‘frustration’ seems to express this and is proposed both as a gloss and as a frame label.The other two occurrences of |hכַּעַס|h* in Ecclesiastes (7:3, 9) appear, from their contexts, to have the senses ‘grief’ and ‘anger’ respectively.
\not (b) In the phrase |hכַּעַס אוֹיֵב|h* ‘the provocation of an enemy’, the 'enemy' could be either a subjective or an objective genitive. A subjective genitive would imply that the enemy was the Experiencer. However, the enemy’s misunderstanding and false claim that it was they who had defeated Israel (v. 27b) would constitute provocation to Yahweh (cf Craigie, NICOT). In this respect, the construction is similar to several instances of the Hiphil of the cognate verb |hכעס|h* where Yahweh is the unexpressed Experiencer.Thus KTBH takes the Experiencer to be Yahweh and the enemy to be the agent and assigns this instance to Use 2a.
\not (c) This is the only use of the plural. There appears to be little or no difference in meaning from the singular in the almost identical constructions in 1Ki 15:30 and 21:22. The plural may signal intensity, 'great provocation' (cf jm §136.f) or 'a repeated series of actions or a habit' (vdm, 1999:185).
\not (d) This understanding is supported by commentaries (WBC, NCBC, EBC) and by TDOT.
\not (e) English translations differ in their treatment of this instance of |hכַּעַס|h*. NIV, NRS and REB translate ‘grief’ (cf KTBH Use 1c); CEV and TEV are similar. RSV, NJV, NJB and also WBC translate ‘vexation’ (cf KTBH Use 2b). The difference appears to be whether |hעָמָל וְכַעַס|h* are seen as cause and effect ‘trouble [which causes] grief’ or as synonyms ‘mischief and provocation [which together provoke anger]’.Since the Psalm focuses on the activity of the wicked, it seems better to take both |hעָמָל|h* and |hכַּעַס|h* as describing that activity, rather than the response of the victim. KTBH thus classifies this instance as Use 2b, ‘something which provokes anger’.

\intro 1. This is a very common word, often meaning ‘to pass over, to pass by, to pass through‘ in a literal sense. Instances of this meaning are listed briefly without analysis as ‘Other meanings’, Meaning 4.2. A particular set of forms of the verb, recognisable in the Hebrew, have a different meaning and refer to anger.3. When the meaning is anger, the key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2a. 3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.4. Meaning 3 is distinguished in Pro 14:16, where the word refers to arrogance. Compare Meaning 2 of the cognate noun. Elsewhere it refers to anger.
\hebraist Most authorities recognise two homonyms for  (BDB, HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT), but express some uncertainty about their relationship to one another and to the noun |hעֶבְרָה|h*. BDB seems to imply an etymological link from |hעבר|h* I (mostly Qal and Hiphil) 'to pass over' to |hעֶבְרָה|h* '[overflowing of] anger, arrogance' to |hעבר|h* II (Hithpael only) 'to be arrogant, furious'. HALOT proposes a link to an Arabic root meaning 'to be nasty' and TDOT appears to refer to the same Arabic root 'be malicious, malice, rancour, resentment'. Only the Hithpael, assumed to be from homonym II is considered a key term.

\not (b) Vul appears to have read |hמתערב|h* (cf 14:16) and this appears to be accepted by NIV and REB. MT does, however, make sense, if understood as '[a passer-by] who gets angry over ...' (cf BDB, ICC) and can be retained (cf NICOT). Similarly, UBS notes that 'the Hebrew text ... is literally “enraging himself” or “is furious.”'
\not (c) The precise meaning is hard to establish. Options are:1. The coordination of |hבטח|h* suggests the meaning 'to be arrogant' as found for the cognate noun |hעֶבְרָה|h*. This is appropriately predicated of a fool. BDB and ICC suggest this, and similarly Reyburn and Fry suggest that the word 'may mean to “be arrogant or excited,” that is, to “lose control.”' (UBS).2. Waltke maintains a sense 'anger' with Yahweh as the unexpressed object of both cola in this verse, ''fears [Yahweh]' and 'gets angry [with Yahweh]' (NICOT). 3. HALOT also maintains a sense 'anger' but differently - 'brings anger upon himself'.4. LXX (cf Syr and Tg) translates |gμίγνυμι|g* 'to meddle', presumably having read |hמתערב|h*, and this also fits the context.KTBH considers that option 1 fits the context best.
\not (d) This gloss is derived from BDB. HALOT proposes a homonym |hבטח|h* II, 'to fall on the ground'.

It may be a plural of intensity (cf jm 136.f, gkc 124.e) or, at least at Job 40:11 and Psa 7:7, it could indicate a repeated series of actions or a habitual behaviour 'outbursts of anger' (HALOT, cf ibhs 7.4.2.c, vdm 24.3.3.v).

\not (a) The experiencer of the anger is not certain, but the phrases 'day of disaster' and 'day of wrath' point to Yahweh.
\not (b) The parallel between death and the day of wrath, over which only Yahweh has power, strongly suggests that this refers to the day of Yahweh's anger.
\not (c) LXX appears to have read |hאבדה|h* (cf 10:28), but MT is the harder reading and should be accepted. Furthermore, there is better parallelism between 'good' and 'wrath' (WBC).Waltke notes that the anger may be the anger of the wicked against others or the anger of God against the wicked, and suggests that both are in view and a pun is intended (NICOT). As ICC points out, however, the book focuses on consequences (Toy 1899, 234), so KTBH concludes that the anger in view is that of God against the wicked.
\not (d) This instance is noteworthy because it is one of the few examples where the target is inanimate.
\not (e) LXX appears to have read |hעבדתו|h* 'his works', which, if understood as 'tilling' provides a good parallel to the first colon. However, since MT makes sense, it should be retained (cf hottp, B rating). Although Toy accepts the reading of LXX, he summarises clearly the options for understanding MT 'the rod of his wrath'. Either it is the 'tyranny of a bad and powerful man' or the wrath that falls on him (ICC 1899).In this case, the 3ms suffix must thus refer either to God as experiencer, or to the wicked person as target. Although God is presupposed throughout the Bible, the one who sows wickedness provides a more active antecedent. KTBH thus concludes that the anger in view is that of the wicked as they oppress others.Murphy notes the difficulties of the verse and translates v. 8b 'and the rod of his pride will fail' but he appears to be a lone voice in taking |hעֶבְרָה|h* to have meaning (2) here (WBC 1998).

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist In this analysis, the Qal expresses a state ‘be angry’ or a process ‘become angry’ while the Hiphil expresses a causative ‘make angry’ in accord with the prototypical senses of the respective stems. Traditional Hebrew lexicography reached the same conclusion, distinguishing a stative Qal (BDB: ‘be wroth’ and HALOT: ‘be angry’) from a causative Hiphil (BDB: ‘provoke to wrath’ and HALOT: ‘to rouse to anger’), though their glosses may have relied too much on the morphology.

\eval Most translations use some variation on the word 'anger': 'was angry (NIV, REB, NJV), 'became angry' (TEV), 'was angered' (RSV). Any of these is a good model to follow. NRS uses 'wrathful' which is acceptable for divine anger. CEV assumes a causal relationship between the first two clauses of the verse and conflates them, 'You had made the Lord angry'. This loses too much of the Hebrew and should not be followed. NJB conflates the second and third clauses, making the second into a prepositional phrase, 'in his anger swore ...'. This may be followed if it is more natural in the receptor language.

These are all good models. NJB and NJV leave the anger implicit, 'you provoked', and this may also be followed, since the anger is explicit in the next clause. CEV conflates the first two clauses, both of which refer to anger, into one, 'you made the Lord so angry that ...' but conveys the causation adequately.There is also the issue of the presence of a synonym in the second clause, typical of similar issues discussed elsewhere.

\not (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its lexical meaning from that of the Qal. BDB may be overinfluenced by the morphology in giving an explicitly reflexive gloss ‘put oneself in a rage’ and Young goes even further, ‘The people will work themselves into a frenzy, exciting themselves to anger‘ (1965:321). If the prototypical reflexive nuance of the Hithpael is present, it may make the people responsible for their own state, ‘they work themselves into a state,’ but HALOT 'fallen into a rage' lacks a reflexive nuance.The Hithpael does, however, also differ slightly in its event frame from the Qal, in that it is a force, distress and hunger, which causes the anger and the target of the anger is the king and their god(s). This different event frame might imply a slightly different nuance. The prototypical link between what causes the anger and its target is broken, so both the anger and its experiencers are less rational. [Note for future research, to be confirmed or rejected: in the ancient Hebrew worldview, if there are no uncaused events, then anger at king and god may be the natural response to distress and hunger.]There is an additional problem here in establishing the Target. In the next clause the phrase  'the king and their god(s)' is governed by |hבְּ|h*. This is unusual with |hקלל|h*, which normally expresses the Target of the curse with an accusative, and the rare instances of |hבְּ|h* (1Sa 17:43) or |hבְּשֵׁם|h* (2Kg 2:24) point to the God or gods invoked to enforce the curse (cf BDB, HALOT). For this reason, most commentators understand the cursers to invoke their king and their gods (WBC, Young, TOTC, KD, but not NICOT). By contrast, most translations take 'the king and their God/gods' to be the Target of the curse and therefore also the anger (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV, NJB). To do otherwise would leave both cursing and anger without any Target, so KTBH recommends following the majority of translations.The final problem is whether or not the God/god(s) who is cursed is Yahweh. Translations and commentaries are divided on the issue, but the occult involvement in v. 19 suggests that ‘their god(s)’ is no longer Yahweh and the translation should not have an upper case G.
\not (b) It might be possible to take the |hעַל |h*normally associated with the Qal of |hקצף|h* as causal and see it as introducing the agent which caused the anger, leading to a gloss, ‘the experiencer was made angry by/because of the agent.’ This passive causative sense, however, would not be prototypical for a verb in the Qal stem.Num16:22b is significant in this connection |hהָאִ֤ישׁ אֶחָד֙ יֶחֱטָ֔א וְעַ֥ל כָּל־הָעֵדָ֖ה תִּקְצֹֽף|h* ‘will one man sin and you be angry with the whole congregation?’ Whether the initial |hה |h*of |hהָאִ֤ישׁ |h*is read as the article, with MT, or repointed as the interrogative (cf. BHS margin), this is a rhetorical question expecting the answer, ‘no.’ Moses and Aaron are proposing a separation of the two participant roles under discussion, that of target, here the whole congregation, and that of the agent which caused the anger, here ‘one man,’ Korah, and reject the proposal. For our purposes, two points are significant. Firstly, at least conceptually, it is possible to separate the two roles, and secondly, it is the role of target that is expressed by the |hעַל|h*-phrase. This conclusion forms the basis of the analysis above.
\not (c) Unusually, the target is more extensive than the agent of the stimulus.
\not (d) The target is expressed with |hאֶל|h* which BHS proposes to emend to the more usual |hעַל|h*. This is plausible, since these prepositions are easily confused (jm §133.b) and some of their senses overlap (ibhs §11.2.13b), but it is unsupported in the MS tradition and is probably unnecessary.
\not (e) Elsewhere, the Hiphil of |hקצף|h* has an object, but MT has none in this case. A pronominal object is, however, present in LXX and Syr. This may reflect a variant text in the |iVorlage|i* or may have resulted from making implicit information explicit. Whatever the original text, the allusion to Exo 17:1-7, where Yahweh is the Experiencer, makes it clear that Yahweh is the Experiencer here too.

For details, see the commentaries, but, in outline, possibilities are:1. Yahweh was angry with Israel for driving Moab to such extreme measures as human sacrifice to Chemosh (KD).2. Israel was angry with itself, taking |hעַל|h* in the sense 'with', for the same reason and left the battle in disgust (WBC, AB and, among translations, REB, CEV, NJB).3. Moab was stimulated by the sacrifice to great anger and effective warfare (WBC).They are all speculative and none is totally convincing, but KTBH considers that Yahweh as Experiencer is less plausible than one or other of the human Experiencers.Other translations are non-committal and leave the Experiencer vague (NIV, RSV, NRS, NJV). This may the best solution for translation.

\intro 1. Although there is only one instance of literal, physical shaking or trembling, that seems to be the central meaning of the word-group. Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts and the trembling may be metaphorical, internal or emotional.2. There is key meaning distinction between someone or something trembling, for whatever reason, Meaning 2, and someone making someone or something else tremble, Meaning 2.3. There are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The following meanings are distinguished by their context: 	1a earthquake	1b theophany	1c fear caused by divine action	1d fear caused by human action	1e divine anger	1f human anger	1g grief	1h excitement	2a theophany	2b fear	2c divine anger	2d excitement4. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\comp Although there is only one instance of literal, physical shaking or trembling (1Sa 14:15), that seems to be the central meaning of the word-group (cf TDOT). Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts. In the context of theophany, heaven and earth tremble. Elsewhere, human trembling results from intense emotion - fear, anger, grief or excitement. In some cases, there may be associated physical trembling but, in others, that disappears from view and the trembling is metaphorical, internal and emotional.1 Stem: Qal or Hithpael; agent: null; theme or experiencer: subject	1a Theme: inanimate; target: null; context: earthquake	1b Theme: inanimate, but personified; target: null; context: theophany	1c Experiencer: human; Cause: divine action; target: null; context: fear	1d Experiencer: human; Cause: human action; target: null; context: fear	1e Experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	1f  Experiencer: human; target: human or God; context: anger	1g Experiencer: human; target: null; context: grief	1h Experiencer: human; target: null; context: excitement2 Stem: Hiphil or Qal; agent: subject; theme or experiencer: object	2a Agent: God; theme: inanimate, but personified; target: null; context: theophany	2b Agent: God or human; experiencer: human; target: null; context: fear	2c Agent: human; experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	2d Agent: human; experiencer: human; target: null; context: excitement

This may have influenced NIV and RSV who translate 'in your anger' and 'be angry' respectively.

\eval The context is clearly one of grief, but translations differ in whether they focus on the trembling, either physical or internal, or on the grief. Thus TEV makes the grief explicit 'was overcome with grief' but at the expense of any nuance of motion, whereas CEV 'started trembling' does not make clear that the trembling arises from emotion and, in English, trembling is not conventionally associated with grief. RSV, NRS and REB render 'was deeply moved'. This is a good model to follow, because it conveys the nuance of motion present in the Hebrew imagery, makes clear that the motion is internal and emotional and allows the contest to make clear that the emotion is grief. It is better than 'was shaken' (NIV, NJV) which is less clearly arising from emotion.

\not (a) Possibly
\not (b) The preposition |hמִן|h* 'from their strongholds' suggests that there is movement from a place as well as movement at a place. |hמִן|h* is common in pregnant expressions (cf gkc 119.x, y, ff) so BDB and HALOT gloss as 'come quivering' and 'to come out quaking with fear' respectively. NICOT takes the phrase after the athnah 'to Yahweh our God' with what precedes 'May they come quaking out of their strongholds to Yahweh our God', but that is not necessary.
\not (c) Assuming that 'the tent-curtains of the land of Midian' is metonymy for the people of Midian (cf NICOT).
\not (d) Most translations and some commentaries (AB, UBS, but not NICOT) emend the following word to |hאֲשֻׁרָי|h* ’my steps trembled beneath me‘ with the support of LXX. This would imply Meaning 1a, but MT is intelligible if |hאֲשֵׁר|h* is taken as causal (cf NICOT) and should be retained.
\not (e) Commentators suggest humour or whimsy, here. 'The earth trembles under three things' may be hyperbole, but, as WBC notes, social cataclysm is sometimes associated with physical disturbance as in Amo 7:10 and 1Sa 2:10.
\not (f) TWOT notes that 'Occasionally its meaning may be difficult to discern. In Gen 45:24 it is usually translated as some kind of arguing or bickering (RSV "quarrel"; ASV, KJV "fall out") following the idea of raging in anger noted above, but this translation is not certain.' Speiser (AB 1982, 339), followed by Hamilton (NICOT) suggests 'let there be no recriminations on the way' which seems to catch the potential very well.
\not (g) Probably.BHS proposes major reordering of MT, but LXX supports MT, which should be retained. In that case, the options for the first two words appear to be 'tremble [with fear of God], so don't sin' or 'tremble [with anger], but don't sin'. Commentators and translations are divided.
\not (h) The only instance where the Qal of |hרגז|h* is transitive is at Ezk 16:43, where the ancient versions appear to have read the vowels for the Hiphil. There is widespread agreement (BHS, BDB, HALOT, NICOT, WBC) that it should be repointed, though Greenberg retains the Qal and proposes that the negative particle in the preceding clause does double duty, 'you were not in dread of me' (AB 1983 1.288).

\intro 1. Unlike the cognate verb, there are no instances of literal, physical shaking or trembling. Nonetheless, that is assumed to be the central meaning of the noun. Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts and the trembling may be metaphorical, internal or emotional.2. there are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The following meanings are distinguished by their context: 	1a theophany	1b divine anger	1c excitement	1d adverse circumstances3. God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It should not be translated by words which can only mean sinful anger.
\altint This form of the root is particularly difficult to classify and the scheme below should be taken as tentative. If the root is accepted as meaning 'to tremble' then that sense can be detected in some cases, but is largely absent for others.

\not (a) NICOT notes that the word |hרֹגֶז|h* 'captures both the clash of the thunder and the fear it arouses in the human breast'. The experiencer may thus be human, but it seems that the 'hearer' feels the shaking of the earth which results from God speaking.
\not (b) Most translations and commentaries support KTBH. There are however minority reports. NICOT notes that 'the word indicates a condition of agitation, excitement, or disturbance' and translates 'in (the time of ) trembling, remember mercy'. AB sees a reference to the trembling of the prophet as in v. 16 where the cognate verb is used.
\not (c) KTBH considers that the trembling in view here is that which results from adverse external circumstances. The theme in this speech of Job is the levelling effect of death, so that even the wicked gain rest from trouble. This understanding is shared by NICOT, 'In Sheol there is no turmoil ... to make one weary, not even for the wicked'.The alternative is expressed by WBC 'their raging' and TOTC '... from troubling others' (following RSV) taking |hרֹגֶז|h* to refer to the rage and malice of the wicked, so that Job is looking for rest in Sheol from that rage. This is possible but fits less well with the overall thrust of the speech.

\sub גּוֹלָה, גָּלוּת, גִּלָּיוֹן
\intro This verb either means 'to reveal' or 'to go into exile.'
\tnotes Note the two main homonyms: 'to reveal' and 'to go into exile'. Within homonym 2 the various meanings of the verb can be broken up by use of frames. The most frequently occurring frame is 'exile' but others also occur.
\hebraist The two homonyms are mainly split by the roots of the verb (1. piel, pual, and hitpolel vs. 2. niphal? hiphil and hophal respectively). The qal, however, can mean either.
\altint NIDOTTE suggests that the word has a core meaning of 'to uncover', but the evidence for this is unconvincing.
\comp This verb has two main meanings - 1. to reveal, or uncover; 2. to go/take into exile. Occasionally the verb is used in one passage with both meanings e.g. Jer 43:3. The second meaning of the verb is broken into the following meanings: 1. To depart 2. To carry away (into exile) 3. To be carried away (into exile) 4. To be removed. Meaning 1. is subdivided as follows: a) to depart (into exile) b) 'to carry away' c) to take captive d) 'to go' e) 'to depart'.  Within meaning 1. the frames separate out the various meanings (see below).
\dfnotes There is no frame that ties all the domains of the verb. If a frame had to be suggested, it would be 'leaving'.
\addinfo Some general notes on the exile follow here. To understand the exile one must first read about God's covenant with his people Israel in the book of Deuteronomy. In that book they are promised many blessings if they obey God, and curses if they do not (Deu 11:26). If they obey God, they will remain in the land which they have yet to conquer, but has been promised to them. If they disobey God they will be removed from the land (Deu 28:63). The term גלה does not occur until the historical books, where it is reported that the Israelites did disobey God, and so they were sent into exile (2Ki 17:23). By this time the kingdom was split into two, the Northern kingdom was exiled to Assyria, and much later the Southern kingdom was exiled to Babylon. The actual dates are 734 and 722 BC for Israel, and 597 and 586 BC for Judah. Of course it did not end there, as some from Israel remained in the North, and eventually became Samaritans, and some in the South remained in Judah at the time of their exile. But the books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell us how a group of believers came back to Jerusalem in Judah and began rebuilding the city walls and the temple. They found that those who had remained in the land had mostly intermarried with the surrounding peoples.

\intro 1. The noun |hמַלְאָךְ |h*refers to any person sent by a superior to deliver a message or carry out a task.2. It also refers to a person or non-human agent sent by God to deliver a message or carry out a task.3. In one case in Ps. 104:4 the wind and fire are called |hמַלְאָךְ |h*of God.4. The term can also be used in describing a person in a comparative way, as in "you are like an angel of God to me." In this case the point of similarity in the comparison varies according to context: examples include appearance, in that they looked bright/strong (like people think angels usually look like), or the angel-like person has done good for the person making the comparison, thus the person is similar in helping or giving blessings to people.
\hebraist The suggested root is l'k from Ug., Arabic and Ethiopic 'to send'. No verb forms of this root are found in BH. The only other word derived from this root is the hapax legomenon |hמַלְאָכוּת|h*, 'message' (cf. Hag. 1:13).

\syntagcc The most common phrase in the OT for the messenger sent by God is 'angel of the Lord'. Also, 'angel of God' or just 'angel' are used. The angel of the Lord can represent or stand in the place of God, and in some passages the text is not clear if God himself is speaking or if an angel is speaking for him. Therefore the angel has all the authority that God has, when speaking to people. Whenever people saw an angel they were afraid they would die, as if they had seen God himself. Whenever the text describes an angel appearing to a person, the angel looks like a human being. In all but one case the angel never eats. In some passages the person does not realise the person he or she is talking to is an angel until after the angel has left. Angels sometimes disappear in miraculous ways, and that helps the person know it was an angel.The spirit-being sent by God often did more than one thing. Sometimes he brought a message and protected, or guided and protected, or protected one party while attacking/destroying another (as with Lot and Sodom). Therefore a verse containing |hמַלְאָךְ|h* might be listed below under more than one category of meaning.

\sub חָרִים, חֵרֶם‏, חֳרֵם, חָרְמָה, חֶרְמוֹן
\tnotes It will not be necessary to reflect every aspect of meaning in every verse. However, particularly when חרמ occurs for the first time in a passage, it would be wise to bring out implicit meanings of the word. Take for example Num 21:2: Then Israel made a vow to YHWH and said, “If you will indeed give this people into our hands, then we will utterly destroy their towns.”  This translation (NRSV) neglects one important implicit meaning of חרמ here, viz. that YHWH is the benefactive of this action. In other words it is not clear why destroying the towns would please YHWH. This is a vow: the Israelites offer to do something (make the towns herem) in return for YHWH’s help (the granting of victory). Put more crudely, this is a contract with God: if he does his bit, we will do ours. In order to bring out this implicit information we would need to say: Then Israel made a vow to YHWH and said, “If you will indeed give this people into our hands, then we will devote their towns to you by utterly destroying them.”  In the footnote for Horma in Num 21:3 we will need to explain this name as "place devoted to destruction". 
\hebraist The verb is used only in the causative stems Hiphil (48 times) and Hophal (3 times)
\dfnotes The Hebrew trilateral root חרמ is a complex idea which is alien to 21st century western thought, but which occurs relatively frequently in the Jewish scriptures. It is one of the most difficult Hebrew terms to translate adequately. As we examine the verses in which חרמ is used, we are able to identify the various facets of the term.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Philip Stern observes that חרמ has “long been considered as a singular ‘consecration-to-destruction of a designated enemy”, but “may equally well (or even better) be described as a ‘consecration-through-destruction’” and also “a destruction through consecration”. Niditch notes that its wide range of meanings includes “to become sacred, inviolable”, “to be accursed”, “to be consecrated for destruction” and a possible association with burning, though Num 18:14-15 specifically excludes human sacrifice. However, I would disagree with Niditch about including an element of curse in חרמ. In my view that is imposing our own cultural understanding on the Hebrew term. A good example of what I mean is the city of Jericho, which was deemed herem and duly ‘devoted to destruction’ (Jos 6:21). However, it is only after Jericho had been reduced to ashes that Joshua (6:26) pronounced a curse (Hebrew אָרוּר) – a concept which is clearly separate from חרמ. The term חרמ contains no more idea of ‘curse’ than עלה (=whole burnt offering). Both terms indicate what is, or should be, totally devoted to YHWH. It was perfectly possible for a place to be חרמ without becoming accursed.	The concept of חרמ is pretty gruesome and has caused serious ethical problems in the minds of many Christians. This leads some of them to try and water down or explain away the term. However, it is not the business of Bible translators to try and sugar the pill of unpalatable, but correct, exegesis. The need is to translate the term accurately and leave the theological implications to preachers.	It is certainly a fact that the concept of חרמ was not exclusively Israelite. As we see from the Mesha inscription, the Moabites also practised it. However, it should be noted that Israel only practised חרמ against selected inhabitants of the Promised Land. Deuteronomy (chap. 7 and 20) lists nations to undergo the herem. Yet Deu 7:2 shows חרמ was never intended as the sole mode of operation (i.e. genocide). חרמ can also be seen as the triumph of created order over chaos (enemies).                                                                   The first instance of חרמ is in Ex 22:19. In other verses which deal with the need to be exclusively loyal to YHWH  (Lev 20:2, Deu 13:5, Jdg 6:21), the penalty for disloyalty is clearly death. Banishment is not an option. There is little doubt that the Torah prescribes the death penalty for Israelites who offer sacrifices to any god other than YHWH. When applied to human beings חרמ entails death; when applied to things it entails destruction. In both cases death/ destruction is generally completed by means of fire. Thus after putting every living thing in Jericho to the sword, “they burned down the city and everything in it; only (the non-combustible) silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of YHWH” (Jos 6:24). There is a very close connexion in thought with the holocaust or whole burnt offering (עלה). People who offer an animal as a whole burnt offering to YHWH are not allowed to eat any of the meat. The animal is totally destroyed. Similarly a town which is herem has to be totally destroyed. No one is allowed to benefit personally from its conquest by taking booty for their own use. Such action is deemed stealing as the goods belong to YHWH. Everything that breathes is put to the sword and then, together with all property taken from the enemy, burned to ashes.חרמ is not only total in its application, it is also irrevocable. There is no special ‘get out’ clause, no exception. Rahab and her household escaped the destruction of Jericho because of their faith in YHWH and identification with his people. This saved them from being destroyed along with the rest of the city because they had ceased to be subject to the law of חרמ. Lev 27:28-29 makes the irrevocable nature of חרמ crystal clear: “Nothing that a person owns that has been devoted to destruction (herem) for YHWH, be it human or animal, or inherited landholding, may be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to YHWH. No human beings who have been devoted to destruction can be ransomed; they shall be put to death.” In other words there is no way something or someone that is חרמ can be “deheremised”. It is like becoming exposed to radioactive contamination. It is not a condition from which you can divest yourself.The recipient of people or things which are devoted to destruction is YHWH. They belong to him and are his property. Thus if anyone appropriates articles which are חרמ, they are stealing. As Jos 7:11 puts it, “Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I imposed on them. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their own belongings.” From this we see that taking something which is חרמ is not only stealing, it is also deceitful and treacherous; it breaks the covenant God has made with his people. He no longer feels obliged to protect them from harm. One individual’s transgression of the חרמ law thus has very serious consequences for the whole nation. His ‘radioactivity’ contaminates the people around him. This brings us to the next element of meaning.There is a grievous penalty for transgressing the law regarding חרמ. Articles or human beings that are חרמ inevitably bring punishment on those who disobey YHWH by taking them for their own profit: they themselves become חרמ. In other words they in turn forfeit their own lives and become liable for destruction. More than that, by taking something חרמ into their home they make every member of their household and indeed their whole nation herem. As Jos 6:18 warns, “As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet and take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.” Unfortunately, a man called Achan disobeyed this command and pilfered some of the loot he found in Jericho, causing the loss not only of his own life but that of his whole family and all their property, not to mention thousands of ordinary Israelites, before his sin was discovered.  King Saul forfeited his kingship when he disobeyed God’s command through the prophet Samuel to annihilate (חרמ) the Amalekites (1Sa 15:3,9,18-19,26). Many Christians are puzzled that God should be so harsh with Saul for what seems a relatively trivial sin, whereas King David literally gets away with murder (after also committing adultery). This is because they do not appreciate how irrevocable the ban (חרמ) is and how contagious it is. The 'herem'ness of the Amalekites and their property rubbed off onto Saul and permanently contaminated him rather like radioactive waste: once it gets into you, you cannot get rid of it and ultimately it will destroy you.In Hebrew thought holiness (קדשׁ) is also contagious (cf. Eze 44:19). The main difference  between קדשׁ and חרמ is that קדשׁ is usually a setting apart for life or use in the service of YHWH, whereas חרמ is a setting apart for death or destruction.                                                                                                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                        1 Philip D. Stern, The Biblical Herem, p1.2  Susan Niditch, War in the Hebrew Bible, p29.3  Stern, p24  Stern, p19,186. The fact that herem does not occur in Kings shows that the laws of Deu 20 are restricted to the aboriginal peoples of Canaan.5 Stern, p96.
\addinfo USES IN COGNATE LANGUAGES (Arabic and Syriac) - It is easy to see the transition in thought from the Hebrew חרמ to the Arabic حرم (haram). Both are very absolute terms. חרמ involves things which are ‘off limits’, things which are totally forbidden to human beings. Something or someone which is חרמ is outside the saving protection of YHWH. The sixth commandment is “Thou shalt not kill”, but people who, for example, trespass in the temple put themselves outside the protection of YHWH and can be put to death without transgressing the sixth commandment because it is forbidden for anyone except a priest to enter those places. The idea of forbiddenness is very strong also in the Arabic haram. Thus for a Muslim the eating of pork is haram. Eating a very small piece of pork or highly processed and refined pork or just an occasional bit of pork will not absolve you from committing what in Islam is considered a very serious sin. It is absolutely forbidden to eat pork in any shape or form and there are no extenuating circumstances. Not even ignorance makes it excusable. It is incumbent on a Muslim to know what he is eating. This is why committed Muslims, like Jews, will go to great lengths to avoid contaminating themselves and thus incurring the wrath of God. Westerners are bemused by Turkish biscuit packets which assure potential consumers that the biscuits contain no pork fat in any form. It seems like a lot of fuss about a non-issue. Westerners would be more concerned about E numbers! One can only understand the Muslim perspective if one bears in mind just how strong and absolute the concept of haram is.	One other interesting development in the use of the h-r-m root is in Syriac, where the causative form is used in ecclesiastical parlance to mean excommunicate. The offender is handed ‘over to satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord’ (1Co 5:5). The person is considered dead to the community. Obviously, this is how the Syriac church applied the concept of חרמ to their own time and community, but no doubt many modern Christians would practise something similar in their church discipline.

\keyverse Whoever sacrifices to any God, other than the LORD alone, shall be devoted to destruction
\eval NRSV "shall be devoted to destruction" well captures the finality of חרמ, and hints that the benefactive is YHWH, but fails to convey the context, viz. it is a command to faithful Israelites to execute any idol-worshippers among them. It sounds as if it is simply the natural fate of an idol-worshipper. The expression "devoted to" could also be miscontrued by an ignorant reader to mean that an idol-worshipper is a fervent supporter of destruction, he is devoted to destroying things. NIV "must be destroyed" conveys the idea of a command, but there is little or no idea that the benefactive is YHWH. It tries to solve this problem by adding a long footnote: "The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the LORD, often by totally destroying them". This may well be the best solution. TEV "Condemn to death" is a clear command and the fate of the offender is expressed unequivocally. However, it is very secular in tone and conveys no idea that the benefactive is YHWH. The same remarks apply to CEV: "Death is the punishment".
\trans The New Turkish Bible has "ölüm cezasına çarptırılacaktır" (=will be made to incur the death penalty) - very similar to the TEV, CEV. This rendering is not completely satisfactory (a footnote like that in the NIV would have been good), but it is better than the Azerbaijani "tamamilə məhv olunsun" (=let [him] be completely destroyed), which sounds like a curse rather than a judicial death sentence.

\keyverse (Including v17) The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to YHWH for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers we sent. 18 As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet [fr 6.18 Gk: Heb "devote to destruction". Compare 7.21] and take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.
\eval The NRSV "shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction" is supposed to be understood as "shall be offered (like a whole burnt offering) to the LORD by being destroyed". However, there are two big problems: 1) There is an ambiguity in the English. 'Devote' generally has a positive meaning and "shall be devoted" could be understood by an ignorant reader as "the city shall become fervent devotees of the LORD for the purpose of destroying things"; 2) "shall be" could be understood as the natural fate of the city as opposed to a specific command to destroy it. The NIV "are to be devoted to the LORD" is even worse since the element of destruction is totally absent and the danger of misunderstanding "are to be devoted" is even more acute. The TEV "must be totally destroyed as an offering to the LORD" is an excellent translation model which successfully addresses both of these problems. The CEV "you must destroy it and everything in it, to show that it belongs to the LORD makes the agent clearer than the TEV, but the second half of the sentence is less natural. I would recommend translating this verse as follows: "You must totally destroy the city and everything that is in it as an offering to YHWH".
\trans Turkish "RAB'be koşulsuz adanmıştır" (=has been devoted unconditionally to the LORD) is unsatisfactory since it is not clear that the city is to suffer total destruction. Thus the Turkish translation could be greatly improved by adding the phrase "for total destruction". The element koşulsuz (=unconditional), whilst eminently defensible, is not so important and could be omitted. The Azerbaijani "məhv edilməyə həsr olunmuşdur və onda olan hər şey Rəbbə təqdim olunmalıdır" (=has been devoted to-being-destroyed and everything in it must be offered to the Lord) is much better. Though it is a bit long-winded, every element of meaning in חרמ has been accounted for.

\eval One point which comes out of this verse is that, despite the NRSV rendering "has been devoted to destruction", חרמ does not always involve destruction. The basic idea is irrevocable loss. In the case of material objects, combustible items are destroyed by fire, but articles of gold, silver, bronze etc are put in the sanctuary. In the case of people, they are put to death. In the case of real estate ('inherited landholding'), ownership passes permanently and irrevocably  to the sanctuary and the property is administered by the priests. The TEV avoids this difficulty by rendering "what he has unconditionally dedicated", but then spoils it by adding a footnote saying that such things had to be destroyed, forgetting that metal items and real estate were not in fact destroyed, but simply remained the permanent property of the sanctuary.
\trans The Turkish "RAB'be koşulsuz adanan" (=which has been unconditionally devoted to the LORD) works well here - better than the NRSV. Introducing the element of destruction is unhelpful here because one of the targets ('inherited landholding'), unlike humans and animals, cannot be destroyed.

[+ fr 25.9  Gk Compare Syr: Heb "and everlasting desolations"]. 
\eval Where YHWH is the agent, there are no problems with translating חרמ as simply "utterly destroy". However, in Jer 25:9 there is a slight problem with this rendering in that the people of Judah were not and never have been "utterly destroyed". It was the existence of an independent state of Judah which was permanently terminated. It might therefore be better to suppress the word "utterly" here and say simply "destroy".

\syntagc As Stern notes, there is a distinct paucity of material on herem in the Kethuvim and by Ezra’s time (6th century B.C.) we also notice a distinct watering-down of the term. In Ezr 10:8 it is used of the forfeiture of goods as punishment for failure to attend a key meeting in Jerusalem. In Dan 11:44 it is used as a synonym for ruin with the element of being devoted to YHWH no longer in focus. Obviously by this time the Jews were no longer capable of making their enemies חרמ. They were in exile and subject from time to time to persecution by tyrannous rulers. Not surprisingly the laws of herem became a dead letter. In Malachi 4:6 the term is rendered curse in the NRSV. It would be better to translate as the REB and say: “lest I come and put the land under a ban to destroy it”. Malachi is unusual in his use of herem in that the subject of the verb is YHWH. It is normally human beings who devote things to YHWH for destruction. Here herem seems to have lost the element of being devoted and simply means doom to destruction.	Besides occurring in proper names like Hermon, Hormah, Horem and Harim (with the general idea of places and people being devoted to YHWH), the root חרמ  also occurs in the word חֵרֶם meaning a net (Ecc 7:26; Ezk 26:5, 26:14, 32:3, 47:10; Mic 7:2; Hab 1:15,16,17). This is the same word which elsewhere means thing devoted to destruction. Unless it is a coincidence, which seems unlikely, the extension of meaning to net seems a piece of rather grim, black humour. The net is the place where a fish becomes herem (devoted to destruction), ending its life there and later getting cooked on the barbecue! The irrevocability of the ban could indeed be likened to a trap or net and the fish’s appointment with the fire of a barbecue resembles the fate of people and property that are herem.

\intro This verb expresses the action that someone with authority or power imposes payment in either monetary or other forms to another.  1. In legal context, it is to make someone pay fine or penalty compensating the loss or damage caused by wrong doings of the person.  Similar legal conducts can become oppressive when it is done unjustly by the authority.2.  A sovereign country demands payment to the vassal.  3. When it is used in the context of Moral teaching, the meaning is simply to punish rather than to impose payment.  The metaphorical point may be having to pay the cost of own action or behaviour.

However the meaning seems to be shifted from 'be wise because ...' to 'do this when ...'.  GNT seems to use 'regret it later' expressing incurred meaning of 'be punished,' but since the meaning of 'to be punished' is not clearly expressed, it is not satisfactory.
\trans Translation approach may be depends on the literary tradition of the target language.  The Hebrew style used in the Proverbs allows logical gaps in the sentence, for some meanings are incurred.

When the payment is imposed to someone in legal setting in appropriate proportion, it is likely that justice was done.  On the other hand, large amount of payment imposed by authority can result in Oppression as such was the case in sovereign-vassal relationship.  Thus, in MEANING 1, domain Oppression is present.

CEV explains this meaning 'to force to pay as taxes'.  However REB and NJB translate as 'impose indemnity' which include the sense of compensation of damage or loss.  However, 2Kings 23:35 gives more detail description of the payment: 'Jehoiakim gave Pharaoh the silver and the gold, and he made an assessment on the land to pay the money demanded by Pharaoh. He exacted from the people of the land the silver and gold to be paid Pharaoh Neco, according to each man’s assessment.' (NJPS).

\intro 1. The primary meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is a cistern, a hole dug in the ground to hold water. The hole or pit was sometimes used as place to imprison people. |hבּוֹר|h* also means prison. However, the prison is not clearly underground so it is not necessarily a dungeon. 2. A figurative meaning is the underworld which is underground, the place where the dead continue exististence, like |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. It is not a grave where dead bodies are buried. The darkness, depth, and unpleasantness of an old, unused cistern could have evoked the place where dead people were. |hבּוֹר|h* is used primarily in a phrase 'those going down to the underworld' as a metonymy for death. All the occurrances are a metaphorical way of referring to death.
\tnotes When it means the underworld, this word is used almost exclusively in the phrase |hיֹורְדֵי בֹור|h* 'those going down to the underworld'. The whole phrase is a metonymy for dying. In the other occurrances, |hבּוֹר|h* itself is the metonymy for death.There is no sense of punishment in this underworld, so words for underworld which involve punishment are not appropriate translations, such as hell. Words for grave could be used when they are a metonymy for death, as they are in English.
\hebraist |hבּוֹר|h* is used primarily in the phrase |hיֹורְדֵי בֹור|h*. This phrase is introduced by the object marker |hאֶת|h* or by the prepositions |hעִם|h*, |hמִן|h*, or |hכּ|h*. |hבּוֹר|h* is always the goal of the verb. When meaning the underworld, the term is used soley in the poetic genre.
\altint Many translations gloss |hבּוֹר|h* with either ‘death’ or ‘grave’. BDB, Raymond, Even-Shoshan give the gloss of 'grave'. IVPBBC gives 'underworld' and 'grave'. Note that all of the occurrances of |hבּוֹר|h* as the underworld are in poetic genre and are a metonymy for death. In English 'grave' is also a metonymy for death.
\evalev The term |hבּוֹר|h* is used almost exclusively with the verb |hירד|h*. This verb is also used with other words for the underworld, but never with the words for grave,  |hקְבוּרָה|h* and |hקֶבֶר|h*, and only once with |h‫מָוֶת‬|h*. The meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is thus most likely 'underworld' rather than 'grave'. Words for grave, underworld, and death are used in similar contexts since they all have to do with death. A person goes down to the underworld at death, and the body is buried at that time. |hבּוֹר|h*  and |h‫מָוֶת‬|h* are used in parallel only three times, and one of these is also with |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. Thus their juxtaposition does not necessarily imply that |hבּוֹר|h* means grave. A menonymous use of |hבּוֹר|h* is a more likely explanation for the evocation of death.
\comp 1. The literal meaning   Frame: Water: Water storage2. A metaphorical extention of Meaning 1  Frame: Imprisonment3. A metaphorical extention of Meaning 1  Frame: Death
\dfnotes The primary meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is a cistern, a hole dug in the ground or rock to hold water. After the cistern was no longer used or usable for water storage, it was sometimes used as a place of imprisonment. By figurative extension, the same word was used for prison or dungeon. Another figurative use was as a name for the underworld, or place where dead people were. The underworld was seen as underground, and dark, like the inside of a cistern. In this meaning |hבּוֹר|h* does not seem to be a place of punishment. Death is not a positive thing, and dying is the punishment. The idea of imprisonment is associated with two other words for the underworld, |hשְׁאוֹל|h* and |hשַׁחַת|h*.The psalmists speak of |hבּוֹר|h* in relation to life and rescue from death and from enemies. The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both speak of |hבּוֹר|h* in the context of punishment. Part of the punishment of God on the surrounding nations is to send their leaders to |hבּוֹר|h*, often used in parallel with |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. Death itself is the punishment because it is a humiliation of those who were leaders and in high position.The most important characteristics of the underworld for the Hebrews were that it was a dark and distanct place underground where the dead people continued their existence. Hebrew uses five terms to refer to it: |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, |hאֲבַדּוֹן|h*, |hשַׁחַת|h*, |hבְּאֵר|h* and |hבּוֹר|h*, and two phrases: |h‫אֶרֶץ נְשִׁיָּֽה |h* (Psa 88:13) and |h‫אֶרֶץ תַּחְתִּיֹּ֖ות‬|h* (Ezk 32:18). It had some characteristics of a prison, like bars and gates, but it was not seen as a place of punishment.

\context The underworld as a metonymy for death
\syntagcc All references for |hבּוֹר|h* as the underworld are in the poetic genre. Although the word refers to the underworld as a place, it is used in the context of death or possible death of the speaker or the person referred to. Often there is a comparison of the troubles of the speaker with one who is dead or 'has gone down to the underworld'. In all but four occurrances, |hבּוֹר|h*  is used within a structured phrase: |hיֹורְדֵי בֹֽור|h* 'those who go down to the underworld'. A phrase which is a metonymy for death in the target language is a possible translations of this phrase. The word 'death' can also be used.

\keyverse ...Don't turn away and leave me here to die. (CEV)
\eval Most translations consulted use the term 'the pit', which does not convey the emotion of the psalmist. CEV and NJBE convey the emotion well by using the phrases 'leave me here to die' and 'sink into oblivion'. TEV refers directly to the world of the dead, which also evokes the negative emotions associated with death and the underworld, but to a lesser degree.

\not (a) Possible meaning. Some translations take |hבּוֹר|h* to mean 'pit' or 'hole' in Prov 28:17, not the underworld. The TOB translates it as 'prison'. Both are possible meanings. KTBH prefers the meaning underworld as a metonymy for death, as in the NRSV, TEV, and FLC among others. The preposition |hעַד |h*implies a a physical distance, which fit into the idea of the underworld being far away, as well as a temporal distance, that is until death. This metonymous use of underworld fits with the other occurances of |hבּוֹר|h* as underworld that are metonomies for death.

\not (b) In Isa 14:19 |hבּוֹר |h* is taken by some translations and lexicons to be the underworld. However, it is also translated as a cistern wthere dead bodies are thrown instead of being buried. |hבּוֹר |h* is repeated four times in this section. This occurrance of |hבּוֹר |h* comes in the midst of Isaiah's prophecy about the defeat and punishment of the surrounding nations. The leaders will all end up in the underworld.This verse appears to use a play on words of the several meanings of |hבּוֹר |h*. Isaiah is making a unique point about the king of Babylonia. He is no better than any of the other kings. His fate is even worse than that of the surrounding nations. Not only will he die and meet the other kings in the underworld, he will not be buried appropriately in a grave like other dead leaders.  His body will simply be thorwn into a pit with other corpses. This was a very shameful thing to have happen to him. The more lavish a funeral and burial rites, the more important a leader was considered to be. His burial reflected how much honor he had among the poeple.

This is a possible translation, since just a few verses before he describes being thrown into a pit with water in it. The phrase is 'mi bor taxtiot' [|hמִבֹּור מִבֹּור|h*], a similar phrase to other underworld words, particularly |hשַׁחַת|h* where deliverance or rescue from the underworld is a common theme. The writer could be playaing on the word for pit by refering to it first as the literal hole in the ground, and the second time as a metonymy for death.

\not (a) The term |hנֵצֶר|h* 'branch' here in Isa 14:19 probably refers to an unwanted or rejected branch of the family (see DOTTE). The song about the king of Babylon rejoices in his dishonor. Elements of this dishonor include having his corpse treated ignobly by not remaining properly buried, like bodies that are thrown into a pit. A play on words with |hנֵצֶר|h* implies he is also rejected by his family, a loathsome branch of the family, another great dishonor. (Question to reviewed: Is this note relevant?)

\sub שׁאה
\intro 1. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is the name of the place where the dead are. It is part of the universe, under the earth, inaccessible to living humans, yet God can see into |hשְׁאוֹל |h*and knows all about it.2. Death is a negative thing because it separates one from society, family, and from God. So |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is also a negative place since one who is there is separated from society and from God. It is not a place of judgement, nor of punishment.3. The phrase 'go down to the underworld' [|hירד שְׁאוֹל‏|h*] is a metonymy for death, or possibly a euphemism for death. As a metonymy, it is used primarily in the speech of individuals in narrative portions, and in poetry. It is often used in parallel with other words for the underworld, such as |hשַׁחַת|h* and |hבּוּר|h*, and with the word |hמָוֶת|h*.4. In Proverbs, |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is the underworld, and is used mainly as a metaphor for the consquences of a wasteful or evil life or the living of an evil life which leads to death. 5. The use of the term |hשְׁאוֹל |h*in poetic and prophetic sections is varied. Sometimes it is personified, sometimes it refers specifically to the place where the dead are, sometimes it refers to death.
\tnotes 1. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was a literal place within the Hebrew cosmos. It is underground, the place where the dead are located after death. The Hebrews believed that the dead continued to exist in this underworld, but had no further contact with the surface of the earth or those still living. There was no intermediate place where the dead spent time. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was the only location of those who were dead.2. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was not a place of judgement or punishment for the Hebrews. Any word in the target language which evokes these ideas, e.g. 'hell' or |ienfer|i* should be avoided. Some of the prophets and psalmists viewed death itself as part of God's punishment, as in Psalm 9:18, Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 31. The punishment is in the loss of honor and importance in the world rather than anything that takes place in the underworld after death.3. The place of the dead and death itself are very closely tied together in the Hebrew text. The implicit domain for |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is Death. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is often used with the word |hמַוֶת|h*, and with other metonymous phrases for death, such as רִמָּה. In the poetic and prophetic passages, the use of the terms for death and the place of the dead are found in parallel and often used as synonyms.  4. The Hebrews used the expression   |hירד שְׁאוֹל |h*to refer to the death of a person. It is possibly a euphemism. The names of the underworld itself, including |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, were used as metonymies for death. Some translations, e.g. CEV, NLT, and NIV, always take |hשְׁאוֹל |h*as a figurative expression for death or the grave. Only where |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is a metonymy for death is this a good alternative. Metonymies in the target languages could also be used. Where |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is referring to the literal place where the dead are within the cosmos, a term for the underworld in the target language is a preferable, if the term is a place underground. If not, a phrase like 'world of the dead' is appropriate. 5. Ezekiel and Isaiah describe the underworld in several prophecies. The kings of the nations which surround Israel are described in the underworld with their honour and importance gone. Because these are prophetic passages, they should not be taken as literal descriptions of what |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is like. The prophecies are descriptions of God's punishment of these evil nations, using the images of the underworld to emphasize how they will loose all their glory and importance when they die.
\hebraist The verb |hירד|h* is used with |hשְׁאוֹל |h*as goal or location to describe the death event. Thus to be saved from death, or to live, uses the verb |hצלה|h*, to go up. Synonyms for |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, such as |h‫שָׁחַת|h* and |h‫בּוּר‬ |h*both also use these verbs. The words |h‫קבֶרֶ‬|h*, |h‫קְבוּרָה‬ |h*or  |h‫מָוֶת‬|h* never use these verbs.
\altint Some commentators equate |hשְׁאוֹל|h* with the grave, as do the NIV. NIDOTTE gives the meaning as both the grave and the underworld because |hשְׁאוֹל|h* collocates with |hאֲבַדֹּון|h* and is used in parallel with |hבּוּר|h* and |hמָוֶת|h*. Although in English 'the grave' can be a euphemism for death, this is not the case in Hebrew. The grave is associated with death because the dead body is put in the grave. But the part of the person that continues existing goes to |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, the underworld. The verb |hירד|h* is used with words for the underworld, but not with words for the grave. Neither are terms for grave used as synonyms for the underworld. Some resemblance between the structure of graves and of |hשְׁאוֹל|h* in implied in various passages. Amos 9:2 implies that one can dig into |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, but the focus here is that the underworld is part of the universe which God knows all about. Words for grave are never used to name parts of the universe.
\comp 1. The place Frame: Universe2. Metonymous use of Meaning 1 Frame: Death
\dfnotes 1. In Meaning 1, the focus is on the location of the underworld in relation to other places in the universe. It is part of the cosmos, evoking the universe domain. All occurrances are in poetry or prophecy.2. In Meaning 2, the word for the underworld refers to the event of death. One dies when one goes down [|hירד|h*] to the underworld. God or a human can send someone down, and a human can go down. Someone who is in the underworld has already died. The people in the underworld are insubstantial, they fade away as a cloud, they are shades. It is a dark place, underground, yet God can see into it and knows all about it. No one can hide from God in the underworld. It is contrasted with both heaven and the earth, the land of the living.3. The underworld is also a metaphor for the danger and fear of death. The Psalmists beg God to deliver them from |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, that is, from death.  The danger of living an evil life is compared to death. Thus, the death event is used as a metaphor for a live of evil.

\eval All the translations consulted are adequate. Most maintain the term 'Sheol', which should have an accompanying note to explain that it is the name of the underworld. The NIV, TEV, and CEV use the term 'grave' rather the name Sheol. This is acceptable in English where 'the grave' is a euphemism for death. The TOB uses the French name for the underworld, |ienfers|i*, which is not advised since it conveys the idea of punishment.

\not (a) Psalm 55:16 uses the same phrase as Num 16:30, 33, 'go down to Sheol alive' [|hירד שְׁאוֹל חַיִּים|h*]. These three verses are the only places this phrase is used. In Numbers, some members of the clan of Kohath of the tribe of Levi challenged the leadership of Moses. They wanted to offer sacrifices just as the priests did.

In Psalm 55, the psalmist complains to God about his companions and close friends who betrayed him, just as the Levites who were the same tribe as Moses betrayed Moses by challenging his authority.

\pos ncf
\gloss pit, underworld
\freq 23
\sub שׁוח
\intro 1. The primary meaning of שַׁחַת is a hole in the ground which is used for a trap.2. Used metaphorically, שַׁחַת means the underworld, a place no one can leave, so a kind of trap. 3. When used metaphorically, the concept of the underworld is often a metonomy for death. Either the word itself or a whole phrase such as תִּקְרַב לַשַּׁחַת "it drew near to shaxat" can be the metonomy.
\tnotes The netherworld, the place of the dead, was seen as underground by the Hebews. It is not the same as the grave where dead bodies are put. It is also not a place of punishment, so words like "hell" where punishment in the underworld takes place are not appropriate.All the words for underworld are used metaphorically to refer to the event of death. S is used often with the words hya (life) and nephesh (soul), in phrases like "abandon my life to שַׁחַת". The whole phrase is a metonomy for death.
\evalev The words for the underworld use the verb ירד, as opposed to words for a burial place which do not use this verb.
\comp 1. The literal object.   Frame: danger2. Metaphorical use of Meaning 1.   Frame: death
\dfnotes 1. The literal object is a hole in the ground, a pit used as a trap. 2. A metaphorical extention of meaning 1 is the underworld, the place underground where the dead are, a trap from which one must escape in order to continue living. שַׁחַת by itself or phrases using שַׁחַת are a euphemism for death. One can be redeemed or ransomed from שַׁחַת, or brought up from שַׁחַת, kept back from שַׁחַת, or not see שַׁחַת, thus one does not experience death.

REB includes the term 'pit', which is an alternative if the target culture has an understanding of the netherworld as being underground. The other translations are not very clear, as they don't specify what or where the 'pit' or 'abyss' is, or how it relates to death.

\eval RSV, NLT translate as "confounded", "dismayed" respectively.

In line with this last set of English translations, NET translates as  "humiliate". We view "humiliate" as the preferred translation, since the intent to humiliate by means of assault is in view. The phrases "no insult can wound/touch/harm me" are also acceptable.

Thus, it may be difficult for local translators to know how they should be distinguished, or if they should be conflated. This makes "blush" an attractive translation. Thus, NLT, CEV are also acceptable, although they ellide the idea of "knowing how to be ashamed."Since the participant roles in view are stimulus>experiencer, NJPS, REB are not preferred, since the idea of causation is not in focus.

In addition, the verb |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’  can be used metaphorically for the rejection of a positive moral value (Meaning 4) and for submitting oneself totally to doing evil (Meaning 3).The final metaphorical meaning (Meaning 5) is uncertain, but seems to refer to the person who is enslaving or exploiting others by a variety of means.
\comp The five meanings of |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ can be basically divided into two groups. Those occurrences that refer to a literal commercial transaction (Meaning 1) and those that are used metaphorically (Meanings 2-5). Meaning 1.  The basic event (focus: the commercial transaction) Meaning 2.  Metaphorical use of 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 3.  Metaphorical use of 1 (focus: control) Meaning 4.  Metaphorical use of 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 5.  Metaphorical and metonymic use of 1 (focus: control)
\dfnotes 1. In Meaning 1 humans sell various items including other humans. This usage triggers the Commercial Transaction frame and the sell sub-frame. The Commercial Transaction frame is used against the background of a variety of domains depending on the item being sold. This includes the Slavery domain and one occurrence that is best understood against the background of the Marriage domain. 2. In Meaning 2, YHWH is selling His people and this use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. One of the background cognitive domains necessary to make this correct interpretation is the 'YHWH is a king' metaphor that is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. YHWH is like a king who has made a treaty with the people of Israel - one that obligates both parties to fulfill certain requirements. When Israel breaks this agreement, by not fulfilling their obligations, then YHWH has the right to respond accordingly. In the context of a king's responsibilities towards his subjects, ‘disown’ means ‘relieve oneself of the responsibility to protect’ which in turn means ‘allow their enemies to defeat them’. The purpose is to punish them for their rebellion. 3. In Meaning 3, a person is selling himself to the control of evil. This use of the verb triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame. This meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Pagan Religions, Evil, and Sin.  A person submits to the control of evil by participating in pagan activities such as divination, child sacrifice, and augury. All of these activities are viewed as evil by God. 4. In Meaning 4, a person is encouraged to not sell truth. This metaphorical use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. This usage is best understood against the background of the Wisdom/Folly domain. Wise people are those who buy (acquire possession of) truth and do not sell (disown or reject) it. 5. Meaning 5 is uncertain, but it seems to refer to an entity that is enslaving or exploiting another by the use of various kinds of evil activities. This metaphorical use of the participle triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame and focuses on the agent of the activity. This metaphorical meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Exploitation, Slavery, and Evil. An entity (the city of Nineveh who is spoken of metaphorically as a harlot) causes the Israelites to submit to her control (i.e., sells them) by means of various evil activities.

\keyverse "Because of the countless debaucheries of the prostitute, gracefully alluring, mistress of sorcery, who |benslaves |b*nations through her debaucheries, and peoples through her sorcery," (NRS)
\eval NRS is an acceptable translation of a verse whose specific meaning is uncertain.  Versions vary widely in their translation of this verse, but none of the 8 translations consulted translated |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ literally. The main grammatical difficulty in translating this verse is determining the semantic functions of |hבִּזְנוּנֶיהָ|h* ‘through her debaucheries’ and |hבִּכְשָׁפֶיהָ|h* ‘through her sorcery’. In most verses with |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ the preposition |hבּ|h* ‘with’ is used to refer to the instrument for which an item is sold, e.g., ‘for twenty pieces of silver’ (Gen 37:28). In at least one verse, the preposition |hבּ|h* ‘with’ indicates the reason the sale was made, i.e., ‘for your sins’ (Isa 50:1). If the first interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations so that she would be able to commit adultery and magic as a result of the sale. If the second interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations because of her adultery and magic. Most translations follow neither of these interpretations. Instead, the phrases are interpreted as the means by which the nations are enslaved or trapped, as in CEV and other versions -- ‘You were nothing more than a prostitute using your magical charms and witchcraft to attract and trap nations’.

\eval The NJPS is an acceptable translation that reflects the interpretation of KTBH (See footnote (a).) Other translations that follow this interpretation include NJB 'roam' and REB 'wander without rest'. NIV appears to follow this interpretation, but their translation choice, 'have gone (to the land)', fails to reflect the continuous nature of the activity. Other translations seem to assign this reference to meaning 1 and have translations that reflect that choice, e.g. ' ply their trade' (RSV, NRSV), 'carry on their work' (TEV), 'go about their business' (CEV).  The translations that have chosen meaning 1 have left the nature of the business of the priest and prophet unstated. If the translator chooses meaning 1 instead of meaning 2, then they should make sure that the translation does not imply that the priests and prophets are not traveling around trading goods.

\intro 1.  The verb |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’ is used most frequently to refer to a commercial transaction that involves the acquisition of an item (including humans) by another human for a price. 2.  Buying an item involves a change of ownership and control. 3. These elements of ownership and control allow for the metaphorical usage of the verb in which items are acquired not through the exchange of money or other items, but through the effort of the person acquiring the item. The effort expended may be that of childbirth (Meaning 2a), God's effort in redeeming people from slavery or in acquiring something by means of warfare (Meaning 2b), and the effort spent on the acquisition of abstract qualities (e.g. wisdom) by a variety of means (Meaning 2c). 4. The verb |hקנה|h* can also mean 'to create' (Meaning 3) a concept related to the issue of ownership and control.
\altint In most major English translations, the five occurrences of |hקנה |h*‘to buy/create’ discussed in Meaning 3 have been consistently translated ‘to create’ or ‘creator’.  The UBS Handbooks on Genesis, Deuteronomy, and Proverbs discuss the positive and negative factors about choosing to translate this verb as ‘to create’ versus ‘to acquire’. (Reyburn and Fry 1997: 324; Reyburn and Fry 2000; Bratcher and Hatton 2000) The NIV includes an alternate translation in four of these verses. In Gen 14:19, 22, NIV lists ‘possessor’ as the alternate translation for ‘creator’ and in Deu 32:6, the alternate translation is ‘who bought you’.  In Pro 8:22, the NIV note suggests the translation ‘possessed me’.  If this interpretation is chosen, then the meanings of these four occurrences would be similar to Meaning 1b. The presence of synonyms in Deu 32:6 that are not economic in nature and the use of the translation equivalent κτ|gί|g*ζω ‘to create’ in the LXX in three of the occurrences, however, provides evidence that these five occurrences probably refer to the creation of items. This does not, however, necessitate the assigning of these meanings to a separate root, as is suggested in some lexicons. Rather, the possibility of alternate interpretations points to the related nature of the concepts of acquisition and creation, i.e. created items are the possessions/acquisitions of the one who created them. This is another example that shows that Hebrew words often have a greater range of meaning than their equivalents in English and other languages. In Pro 8:22 |hקנה|h* ‘to buy/create’ refers to the creation of wisdom using a metaphorical extension of Meaning 2a. The metaphorical nature of this occurrence can be seen by the use of the term |hחִיל |h*‘to bring forth’ in Pro 8:24-25 to describe the same event. The interpretation/translation of Pro 8:22 has varied through the years as a result of the use of this verse in theological debates.  These theological debates may have had some affect on the early revisions of the LXX, which revised the Old Greek from |gἔκτισε |g*‘he created’ to |gἐκτήσατο ‘he acquired’. As a metaphorical extension of Meaning 2a, this usage of |g*|hקנה|h* ‘to buy/create’ in Pro 8:22 has been assigned to Meaning 3 ‘to create.’ Because of collocational clashes inherent in the image of God giving birth, it is likely that |hקנה |h*will need to be translated as ‘to create’ rather than 'to produce'.  Similes will also probably need to be used in Pro 8:24-25 to communicate the similar concept of  |hחִיל |h*‘to bring forth’, that is used in Pro 8:24-25.
\evalev A brief examination of the translation of the phrase |hהִקְנַ֥נִי אָדָ֖ם|h* ‘a man has acquired me’ in Zec 13:5 will quickly illustrate the fact that the MT has been emended and read in a variety of ways in major English translations.  Among the translations examined for KTBH, the most frequent translation was based on the emended text |hאדמה קניני|h* ‘ground is my possession’, as may be seen in the following translations: ‘the land has been my possession’ (RSV, NRS, REB) ‘the land has been my livelihood’ (NIV), ‘the land has been my living’ (NJB), ‘I have farmed the land’ (TEV). In the CEV this phrase is apparently viewed as a parallelism that could be collapsed and hence there is no specific translation of the phrase. The NJV has a rather unique translation that evidently reads the word |hאדם|h* ‘man’ as being connected with the root meaning ‘red’ and therefore translates it as follows: ‘I was plied with the red stuff’ (NJPS). In addition, the NEB has read the root as being from the verb |hקנא|h* ‘to be jealous’ and has translated it accordingly as ‘who has been schooled in lust’ (NEB). (Smith 2002: 280) While the majority of the major English translations followed an emended text that leads to a very smooth reading, HOTTP suggests translating it as ‘a man has acquired me <as a slave>’, which follows the MT (Barthélemy, Prophetical Books II 1980: 422). The LXX translates the verb by the term |gἄνθρωπος ἐγέννησέν με |g*‘a man has given birth to me’, which seems to indicate that the translator was reading a text similar to the MT, though he did not use the unmarked translation equivalent |gκτάομαι |g*‘to acquire’ for the translation of the verb |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’. Some translations, such as the Tok Pisin Bible, reflect an interpretation based on the MT. This translation reads as follows: Mi stap wokboi nating bilong wanpela man ‘I am the slave of one man.’ The Tok Pisin translation reinforces the preceding statement, i.e. he is just a slave and therefore he could not be a prophet. In an ideal world, KTBH recommends that the MT and the recommendations of the HOTTP be followed. KTBH recognizes, however, that in order for a translation to be accepted the emended text that is used by most major translations in English may need to be followed.
\comp The three meanings of |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’ can be basically divided into three groups.  Those that refer to a literal commercial transaction (Meaning 1), those in which 'buy' is used metaphorically for a type of acquisition (Meaning 2), and those that refer to the event of creation (Meaning 3). Meaning 1.

\eval Many English translations (NRSV, RSV, NJV, REB) use the term 'buy', which properly focuses on the acquisition of the item, to translate both occurrences of |hקנה|h* in this verse. Some translations, however, use the term 'pay' (NIV, TEV, CEV) or an even more generic 'give ... a price' (NJB). While both 'pay' and 'give ... a price' are still in the Economic Domain, they focus more on the transfer of money than on the acquisition of an item, which is a major component of the meaning of |hקנה|h* 'to buy'.

\eval 'Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."' (NRS) The NRS translation 'produced' focuses on the immediate context of childbirth and translates accordingly. Other English translations of a similar nature include  'brought forth' (NIV) and 'brought into being' (REB). If this interpretation is followed, then this reference might fit better with Meaning 3, i.e. 'to create'. Because of the similarities between Meanings 2a and 2b, however, it seems better to translate the term using more generic terms for the acquisition of something, e.g., 'got' (CEV), 'have gotten' (RSV, TEV), 'acquired' (NJB) and 'gained' (NJV). In many languages, these kinds of generic terms for acquisition are the natural way of euphemistically referring to childbirth.

Other translations use terminology from the slavery or exile frames, such as 'set free from slavery' (TEV), 'rescued for your very own' (CEV) and 'You have ransomed' (NJV). A few translations use neutral terminology such as 'acquired' (NRS) and 'made your own' (REB). Either of these last two approaches is an improvement over the use of terminology from the Commerce Domain.

\eval Most translations use a general term for acquiring an item -- 'get' (NIV, NRS, REB, RSV), 'acquire' (NJV) 'gain' (NJB). If a language does not speak naturally about acquiring abstract qualities, then a better non-literal translation would be as follows: "It's much better to spend effort on becoming wise than on getting gold and on becoming sensible than on getting silver." This non-literal translation maintains the emphasis on the process that is indicated by the use of |hקנה|h* 'to buy'. CEV is an example of a non-literal translation, but it incorrectly shifts the emphasis from the acquiring of the attributes to the state of the person after the acquisition of these abstract qualities. "It's much better to be wise and sensible than to be rich." (CEV) In addition, CEV collapses the parallel lines, which is not an approach recommended by KTBH.

\syntagc The word |hרְכוּשׁ  |h*does not appear to include human beings (Gen 14:16, 21 ). It does, however, sometimes include animals (Gen 36:7). At other times, |hרְכוּשׁ|h*   appears to refer to items in addition to or other than certain types of animals that are listed separately (Gen 46.6). Hence |hמִקְנֶה|h* can be in both a part-whole relationship with |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e., possessions including livestock, and it can also be the opposite of  |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e. livestock and NOT possessions. Some examples may be interpreted in at least two different ways. For instance, the phrase |h לִבְהֶמְתָּם וְלִרְכֻשָׁם וּלְכֹל חַיָּתָֽם׃|h* may be interpreted as referring to two coordinated items that are exclusive of each other and both of these two items are included in the all living creatures category. A second interpretation is that each of these three terms refer to distinct referents that are exclusive of the other two items. In this interpretation, the term |hחַיָּה|h* would refer to other animals that are are neither cattle nor possessions, i.e., wild animals.

\eval Most translations retain a literal translation of this phrase due to the extended nature of the metaphor or shaving with a razor. As is is true with many metaphors, some aspects of the normal meaning of the word are not easily interpreted.  When an item is hired, the payment is usually made to the owner of the item.  God obviously is not making a monetary payment to a person for the use of the 'razor', though the CEV does translate in that way, 'CEVUK - The Lord will pay the king of Assyria to bring a razor from across the River Euphrates and shave your head and every hair on your body, including your beard.' The TEV translates in a similar manner, 'the Lord will hire a barber from across the Euphrates'. The CEV and TEV are not recommended models. Because of the difficulty of understanding to whom the payment is made, some translations choose not to make explicit the the fact that God 'hired' the razor.  For instance, in the Tok Pisin translation (PNG), God simply 'gets' the king of Assyria and uses him like a razor.  If the metaphor 'hired razor' is not understand properly, then an approach similar to that used in Tok Pisin is recommended.

\eval Several translations (NRS, NIV, RSV) maintain the same translation of |hשָׂכָר |h*for both humans and animals, i. e., 'wages'.  Wages for animals, however, are generally given to the owner of the animal. Because of this, several English translations differentiate between the two, e.g., 'men were not paid their wages and nothing was paid for the animals either' (NJB) and the NJPS above. Other translations shift to a more generic terminology that can be used for both people and animals, e.g., 'neither people nor animals were rewarded for their work' (CEV) and 'no one could afford to hire either men or animals' (TEV). If a language differentiates between wages for animals and people, translators are encouraged to follow the model in NJPS or NJB.

\syntagc Most lexicons treat the 'wages' received from God as being different from a 'real wage'. While this can be justified on the basis of the connection of these terms with different domains, such as Salvation and Prosperity, it is also possible that the analysis is affected by theology, i.e., the belief that works are not directly connected with salavation and other positive aspects of life.

\keyverse You shall |bsell |b*me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot-- (NRS)
\eval Many English translations translate |hשׁבר |h*with 'to sell' (NRS, RSV, NIV, CEV). Other English translations shift the focus from the perspective of the seller to the perspective of the buyer and use the translation 'to pay for' ( REB, TEV) or 'to supply for money' (NJPS). This may be due to the social setting and the fact that the use of a term from the seller's perspective may seem unnatural when used by the buyer because it sounds too demanding. CEV makes it sound less like a demand by saying, 'You can even sell us ...'. NJB uses a similar strategy by saying 'I shall eat and pay for the food you choose to sell me'.  The translator is encouraged to compare the terminology used in Deuteronomy 2.28 and 2.6.  The reaction of the king to the request in Deuteronomy 2.28 suggests that the request may have been viewed as a demand rather than as a request, but this may have been due to other factors in the social setting and not due to the choice of terminology in the request.  The use of |hנתן|h* 'give' for the sale of water is similar to terminology used for the negotiation of a commercial transaction in Genesis 23. Because of this it is best to translate the verse as a polite request and not as a demand if the receptor language distinguishes between these two types of speech.

\eval Most English translations have chosen a literal translation 'broken spirit' (NRS, RSV, NIV, ). The NJPS translation is better in that it has tried to actually translate the term, i.e., a contrite spirit.  Because there is only one occurrence of this phrase in the Hebrew Bible, it is almost impossible to determine the exact meaning.  The word  'spirit' is used to refer to one's character. The TH recommends the use of the term 'humble', which is the meaning of the idiom 'broken spirit' in English.  In Hebrew, however, there are other idioms that clearly refer to humility, e.g.   'lowly spirit'. Because of the context in Psalms 51.19, i.e., sacrifices that generally refer to the removal of sin or the affects of sin, it is best to choose a translation that will fit with the attitude or character of a person who is seeking forgiveness, e.g. a contrite attitude.

\eval The NIV retains both the physical action and the meaning of the physical action in their translation. If the physical action of clapping hands has a different meaning in the receptor language and the inclusion of the physical act causes confusion, then it would be best to leave out the physical action and focus on the meaning of the action in the translation. A model of this approach to the translation of the idiom 'clapping of hands' can be seen in the following translations:  'to give a pledge' (NRS), 'gives a guarantee' (REB), and 'offers guarantees' (NJB). The NJV's translation 'gives his hand' should probably not be followed because it is ambiguous as to the exact meaning of the action of giving a hand. TEV and CEV both collapse the parallelism in the verse and use a phrase to translate both terms from the Economic domain. This approach should only be used if there are no other options due to lack of vocabulary for economic activities in the receptor language.

\eval Most translations read 'serve as priests' or similar. But the passage distinguishes priests from Levites, and this verse seems to refer to the latter. If so, the verb |hכהן|h* must refer to their service as Levites rather than as priests. An alternative interpretation would be to understand vv.13-14 as chiastic, so that v.14a refers to Levites and v.14b refers to priests.

\intro 1. This word refers primarily to priests serving God in the Tabernacle and the Temple.2.  It is also used for other priests of God and for priests of pagan gods.3.  In a few cases it refers to a special relationship with God.4.  In three places where the meaning is sometimes understood as 'royal adviser', KTBH prefers to understand a reference to an unofficial priesthood.
\tnotes 1. The role of a |hכֹּהֵן|h* is very different from that of the leaders of Christian congregations (see 'New Testament' below). Therefore it is inappropriate to translate this word with a term which is used primarily for Christian leaders.2. Uses 1b and 1d refer to the single High Priest, who had special functions. But this role was not clearly defined during the early monarchy period. In translation, a special word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be used when the Hebrew word is qualified by |hגָּדֹול|h* or |hרֹאשׁ|h*. When the Hebrew is simply |hכֹּהֵן|h* but the reference is to someone elsewhere identified as High Priest, the word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be appropriate, but other prominent named priests should not be assumed to be the High Priest.3. The leaders (plural) of the priests mentioned at 2 Chronicles 36:14 and Ezra 8:24, 29; 10:5 should be distinguished from the singular High Priest; a rendering like 'chief priests' may be misleading.4. |hכֹּהֵן|h*, and Aramaic |hכָּהֵן|h*, is related to the Arabic word |ikāhin|i*, which has been borrowed into other languages. The meaning in Arabic is rather different from the Hebrew, more like 'diviner', but in some other languages this word is used in the sense 'priest' and so may be an appropriate rendering of |hכֹּהֵן|h*.
\hebraist The noun |hכֹּהֵן|h* may be understood as the participle of the otherwise unknown Qal form of the verb |hכהן|h*.
\nt The Greek equivalents of |hכֹּהֵן|h*, |gἱερεύς|g*, also |gἀρχιερεύς|g* 'High Priest, chief priest', are used in the New Testament almost entirely of Jewish priests, and only once of pagan priests (Acts 14:13). They are used of Jesus Christ only in Hebrews. They are also used three times in Revelation (1:6; 5:10; 20:6; cf. |gἱεράτευμα|g* 'priesthood' 1 Peter 2:5,9) of all Christian believers; these uses allude to Exodus 19:6, and so relate to Meaning 3 below and bring out the idea of a priest as an intermediary between people and God but with no sacrificial function. But they are nowhere used as a specific term for Christian leaders, who did not offer sacrifices; their relationship with other Christians should not be compared to that of Jewish priests with other Jews.

\dfnotes |hכֹּהֵן|h* is a cultic term. The great majority of its uses refer to those charged with leading worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple. A smaller number relate to other worship of God and to worship of pagan gods. Just a few times the word is used to indicate a special relationship with God.The analysis of this word and of its cognates is based on an understanding that in Hebrew thinking there were several distinct domains of worship. These are distinguished by different settings, regulations, associations, and sequences of events, and by the biblical authors' different attitudes towards them. Therefore a distinction is made here between Worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple, Worship at local shrines (i.e. authorised worship led by Levites), Unofficial Israelite worship of God (including worship not authorised by the Law of Moses), Non-Israelite worship of God, and Worship of pagan gods. The precise distinctions between these domains are unclear, and sometimes depend on the different perspectives and evaluations of different biblical authors.The main duties of a priest in the Tabernacle and the Temple were to offer sacrifices. Subsidiary roles included teaching and prayer, and seeking guidance from God. Certain sacrifices could be offered only by the single High Priest. Priests at local shrines also offered some sacrifices, although this is not permitted by the law of Moses; this is why Josiah closed down the local shrines (2 Kings 23:8, 9). The main roles of non-Israelite priests also seem to have been sacrificial.

\not (a) Aramaic references.
\not (b) In this verse |hכֹּהֵן|h* is used in parallel with |hכֹּמֶר|h*, in a way suggesting that two different groups are referred to. The latter word surely refers to the priests of Baal, as in 2 Kings 23:5, and so it seems likely that the former refers to apostate priests of the Temple of God, cf. 3:4. Therefore this occurrence of |hכֹּהֵן|h* is listed under this contextual use.
\not (c) Aramaic |hעֲבִידָה|h*.
\not (d) The references listed here are only those in which the priests relate to the instruction or law as guardians or instructors.
\not (e) The High Priest is only sometimes distinguished by the qualifying terms |hמָשִׁיחַ, גָּדֹול, רֹאשׁ|h*. More often he is distinguished from other priests by longer expressions or from the context. Hilkiah seems to have been the first priest given the title |hהַכֹּהֵן הַגָּדֹול|h*, but some earlier priests were known as |hכֹּהֵן הָרֹאשׁ|h*.
\not (f) These named priests are not specifically called High Priest, although some of them seem to have served as such. In the early monarchy period there does not seem to have been a single High Priest; during David's reign Zadok and Abiathar seem to have shared the leading role.Included here are the following references to priests by name:|hאֶלְעָזָר |h*Eleazar (before the death of Aaron): NUM 3:32; 4:16; 17:2,4; 19:3,4|hאִיתָמָר |h*Ithamar: EXO 38:21; NUM 4:28,33; 7:8|hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas, son of Eleazar: NUM 25:7,11; 31:6; JOS 22:13,30,31,32|hעֵלִי |h*Eli: 1SA 1:9; 2:11; 14:3|hחָפְנִי |h*Hophni and |hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas: 1SA 1:3|hאֲחִימֶלֶךְ |h*Ahimelech: 1SA 21:2,3; 22:11; 2SA 8:17; 1CH 18:16|hאֶבְיָתָר |h*Abiathar: 1SA 23:9; 30:7; 2SA 15:35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:7,19,25,42; 2:22,26,27; 4:4; 1CH 15:11|hצָדֹוק |h*Zadok: 2SA 8:17; 15:27,35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:8,26,32,34,38,39,44,45; 2:35; 4:4; 1CH 15:11; 16:39; 18:16; 24:6; 29:22|hעֲזַרְיָהוּ |h*Azariah: 1KI 4:2|hיְהֹויָדָע |h*Jehoiada: 2KI 11:9,9,15; 12:3,8,10; 2CH 22:11; 23:8,8,9,14; 24:2,20,25; and an earlier Jehoiada: 1CH 27:5; and a later Jehoiada: JER 21:26|hאוּרִיָּה |h*Uriah: 2KI 16:10,11,11,15,16|hפַּשְׁחוּר |h*Pashhur: JER 20:1|hצְפַנְיָהוּ |h*Zephaniah: 2KI 25:18; JER 21:1,25,29; 37:3; 52:24|hיְהֶזְקֵאל|h* Ezekiel: EZK 1:3|hעֶזְרָא  |h*Ezra: EZR 7:11,12,21; 10:10,16; NEH 8:2,9; 12:26|hמְרֵמֹות |h*Meremoth: EZR 8:33
\not (g) |hכֹּהֵן|h* and |hסֹופֵר|h* are used in parallel only of Ezra. In the Aramaic references Ezra 7:12,21 the parallel is between |hכָּהֵן|h* and |hסָפֵר|h*.
\not (h) Included here are the following references to High Priests by name:|hאַהֲרֹן |h*Aaron: EXO 31:10; 35:19; 39:41; LEV 1:7; 7:34; 13:2; 21:21; NUM 3:6; 18:28; 26:64; 33:38; JOS 21:4,13; EZR 7:5|hאֶלְעָזָר |h*Eleazar (after the death of Aaron): 26:1,3,63; 27:2,19,21,22; 31:12,13,21,26,29,31,41,51,54; 32:2,28; 34:17; JOS 14:1; 17:4; 19:51; 21:1|hאֲמַרְיָהוּ |h*Amariah: 2CH 19:11|hעֲזַרְיָהוּ |h*Azariah: 2CH 26:17,20; and another Azariah: 2CH 31:10|hחִלְקִיָּהוּ, חִלְקִיָּה |h*Hilkiah: 2KI 22:4,8,10,12,14; 23:4,24; 2CH 34:9,14,18|hשְׂרָיָה |h*Seraiah: 2KI 25:18; JER 52:24|hאֶלְיָשִׁיב |h*Eliashib: NEH 3:1,20; 13:4,28|hיְהֹושֻׁעַ |h*Joshua: HAG 1:1,12,14; 2:2,4; ZEC 3:1,8; 6:11
\not (i) These references seem to be to a priesthood in Israel predating and separate from the order of Aaron - including in Psalm 99:6 where Moses as well as Aaron is named as a priest.
\not (j) 2 Samuel 8:18 seems to state clearly that David's sons were priests; compare also 2 Samuel 20:26 and 1 Kings 4:5. But this contradicts the law of Moses which allows only descendants of Aaron to be priests. The Levitical priests Zadok and Ahimelech are listed in verse 17. So it is often suggested that here |hכֹּהֵן|h* means not 'priest' but 'royal adviser', as in NIV; compare LXX |gαὐλάρχης |g*'chief of the court'. However, the law of Moses was not obeyed in every detail during the time of David, and the text should not be adjusted to make it appear that it was.In the parallel passage, 1 Chronicles 18:17, the text reads, in place of 'priests', literally 'first to the hand of the king'. It seems probable that the text of 2 Samuel was changed in 1 Chronicles as part of its presentation of David as an ideal king who observed the law of Moses. The LXX translator may have had similar reasons for adjusting the text.In the light of Psalm 110:4, it is possible that David appointed his sons to the priesthood of God Most High who was worshipped in pre-Israelite Jerusalem, i.e. as successors of Melchizedek. (In the light of the New Testament, these sons of David would also be precursors of the greater Son of David who was also called a priest of the order of Melchizedek, Hebrews 6:20.)
\not (k) The text of Hosea 4:4 is commonly emended e.g. to 'for with you is my contention, O priest' (RSV), which implies that the addressee Israel is here being referred to as a priest. But the text as written makes sense, and is accurately translated 'for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest' (NIV). The meaning of this in context is obscure, but the priest referred to here, as elsewhere in Hosea (cf. Amos 7:10 where this is clear), is presumably one of the non-Aaronic priests of the northern kingdom of Israel.
\not (l) In view of v.18 and 1 Kings 16:31, 32, it is assumed that the priests mentioned in 2 Kings 10:11 are priests of Baal, not non-Aaronic priests of God. But it is possible that priests of God are also being referred to here.

CEV 'be a priest' and TEV 'help the priests' are confusing because these people were already priests. REB 'a turn of priestly duty' is another likely understanding.

\intro This pejorative word is used three times, only of priests of pagan idolatrous worship by Israelites.
\tnotes |hכֹּמֶר|h* is a pejorative term. It is used in modern Hebrew of Christian ministers, but translators are not advised to translate this word with a word used for Christian ministers.
\hebraist The verb |hכמר|h* is formally a cognate of this noun, but it is not a key term.
\dfnotes This word is used only of priests of pagan gods and only when this worship is by Israelites; contrast |hכֹּהֵן|h* which is used rather rarely in such a context, only of the priests of Baal in the northern kingdom in the time of Ahab and Jehu. It would appear that |hכֹּמֶר|h* is a pejorative word, used of those who were not recognised as proper priests, at least by the theologically orthodox in Judah.In Zephaniah 1:4 the words |hכֹּמֶר|h* and |hכֹּהֵן|h* are used in parallel, apparently of two separate groups.

\intro 1. The most basic use of this word refers to Levi son of Jacob. This is not a key term.2. The word commonly refers to the tribe of which Levi is the ancestor. This is also not a key term.3. Most commonly, the word is used of the Levites in their role of serving in the Tabernacle and the Temple.4. In a few cases the word is used to describe the priests of the order of Aaron, who were a part of the Levites.
\hebraist Technically, there are two homonyms here: the personal name, which is Meanings 1 to 3 (Strong's number 3878), and the derived gentilic form, which is Meanings 4 to 6 (Strong's number 3881, also all of the Aramaic references). But, as is regular with personal names ending in |h־ִי|h*, the gentilic suffix |h־ִי|h* is assimilated, so that the form of the gentilic is identical to that of the personal name. As commonly happens, the gentilic may be used either as a noun (Meanings 4 and 5) or as an adjective (Meaning 6).

\gloss sacrilege
\freq 13
\sub נבל
\intro This rare noun is normally used only when the most shocking crimes have been committed. For instance, four of its 13 occurrences are found in the story of the atrocity in Gibeah (Judges 19-20). It indicates a flagrant violation of one of the most revered standards of morality - the kind of shocking crime that provokes public outrage and God’s indignation. In biblical usage the noun seems to elicit two lexical meanings, but the first has two contextual uses: 1. Sacrilege1.1 A scandalous act (10 x)1.2 Sacrilegious speech against God (3 x: Isa 9:17; 32:6; Jer 29:23)2. Penalty for sacrilegious speech against God (Job 42:8)1.1 The first contextual use refers either to gross sexual sin or to grave violations of treaty agreements (according to the available corpus). It commonly forms part of a fixed expression - ‘to commit a crime that causes a scandal among the people of Israel’. This fixed expression points to the fact that such scandalous offences outrage the entire nation. People closest to the victims are especially angered, as is God. Such offences break a moral or religious code that the Israelites hold to be sacrosanct (untouchable). They bring great shame to the community, especially to those most closely associated with the doer and the victim. They call for the immediate death of those who do them, and sometimes of people closely associated with them. The people who do such things in the Bible are always destroyed. 1.2 The second contextual use refers specifically to scandalous lies about God’s character or about God’s dealings with humans, sometimes while also falsely claiming to be speaking God’s message with God’s authority. In these cases, God is more directly affected (dishonoured) as the victim, because his true nature is misrepresented when people speak incorrectly about him or about his moral standards. 2. There is one case of the term referring not to the offence itself, nor to the scandal it causes, but to the penalty that is warranted by such a serious offence. Translators should find a strongly-worded expression that emphasises both the enormity of the offence (to God and to the entire community) and the serious consequences it brings (to the doer and to the community as a whole). Only very bad people commit such very bad crimes. They are not minor mistakes that anyone might make. They are deliberate and flagrant violations that shock and horrify respectable society. For the second contextual use, translators might consider explicitly stating the nature of the crime and the identity of the victim, such as ‘shocking lies about God’. The second lexical meaning might require an expansive translation, such as ‘punish you as severely as your wrong talk about God deserves’ (Job 42:8).More details about understanding and translating the following instances are available:Deu 22:21; Jos 7:15; Jdg 19:23, 24; 20:6, 10; 1Sa 25:25; 2Sa 13:12; Job 42:8; Isa 9:17; Isa 32:6; Jer 29:23
\altint LexiconsBDB defines this noun as ‘disgraceful folly (wanton deed)’, but makes God the agent in Job 42:8 (‘i.e. deal out to you disgrace, expose you and punish you as ~ylib'n>, because of your utterances about me’). But see Is ‘folly’ an adequate translation equivalent? and Who is the agent in Job 42:8?HALOT also gives two meanings: ‘stupidity, folly’ (1Sa 25:25; Job 42:8) and ‘wilful sin, sacrilege’. HALOT’s analysis of this word is a significant improvement on BDB’s, but it still retains the idea of folly in two instances. Yet there is nothing in the context of either of these that would necessarily prevent the scandal frame from being evoked, albeit with some elements behaving as weaker implicatures. See Domain and frame relations and Is ‘folly’ adequate in 1 Samuel 25:25?.0.0.0.1	NIDOTTE and Phillips 1975The NIDOTTE entry relies heavily on Phillips (1975:237-242), who divides the biblical usages into three groups, based on the kind of offence referred to: 1. Those that refer to ‘sexual acts’: Genesis 34:7; Deuteronomy 22:21; Judges 19:23, 24; 20:6, 10; 2 Samuel 13:12; Jeremiah 29:23.2. Those that pertain to ‘nonsexual acts’: Joshua 7:15 and 1 Samuel 25:25.3. Those that apply to ‘the spoken word’ (particularly when misrepresenting God or his moral standards): Job 42:8; Isaiah 9:17; 32:6; Jeremiah 29:23.Phillips (1975: 238) claims that the word can ‘best be rendered as ‘an act of crass disorder or unruliness’ or ‘acting in an utterly disorderly or unruly fashion’.’ This seems rather weak when we consider the extreme reactions of recoil and horror that are associated with the use of the word. The radical response to Achan’s felony (Jos 7) and to the crime against the Levite (Jdg 19-20) could hardly be warranted if the crime in each case was no more than a ‘disorderly and unruly action in breaking a custom’.Perhaps Philips paid too much attention to the case of Nabal’s custom-breaking miserliness (1Sa 25:25). But this an unusual usage of the word, which can be accounted for by Abigail’s employment of two rhetorical devices: 1.	Wordplay: A wordplay is formed with Nabal’s name (lb'n' ‘unscrupulous scoundrel’).2.	Hyperbole: In order to appease David, Abigail overstates the enormity of the crime. She emphasises that David is in the right because her husband’s behaviour is so disgraceful that it evokes censure, reproach and even outrage. In a culture that values hospitality so highly, Nabal’s meanness is extremely shameful and, in this case, dangerous. It was not too much of an exaggeration to use this expression. But Nabal’s offence is still not on the same level of gravity as the other occasions when the word is used, such as Achan’s disobedience to the sacred ban. Evidence for this claim is found in David’s response (1Sa 25:39). If Nabal’s miserliness had been as serious as other ‘scandalous crimes’, then David’s vow to kill all the males in Nabal’s household (verse 22) would not have been entirely uncalled for. Yet David is relieved that God had kept him from doing this ‘wicked act’ (h['r', verse 39). By contrast, Achan commits such an outrageous violation that he infects all Israel. His defiance of the ban treaty is so contemptibly scandalous that it requires the most drastic measures to rid the nation of its contaminating effect. Not only is Achan destroyed but his whole household and all his possessions. Nabal, on the other hand, dies alone (1Sa 25:38). Despite the weaker implicatures involved in this case, the offences referred to by this expression are far more damaging and shocking than mere ‘disorderly conduct’ or ‘folly’. See Domain and frame relations and Is ‘folly’ adequate in 1 Samuel 25:25?.
\evalev A detailed investigation of some of the biblical usages follows, including discussions of Judges 19-20, 1 Samuel 25:25, Isaiah 9:17 and Job 42:8. Five issues are addressed: 1.	Evidence for extremity (Jdg 19-20)2.	Is ‘folly’ an adequate translation equivalent?3.	Translating 1 Samuel 25:254.	Understanding Isaiah 9:175.	Who is the agent in Job 42:8? God’s displeasure or the friends’ folly? 0.0.0.1	Evidence for extremity (Jdg 19-20)One of the most significant elements of meaning (domains) linked to the scandal frame is Extremity. This relates to almost every other aspect of meaning (domain) associated with the frame: not only to the extreme offensiveness of the crime (the enormity), but also to the reactions of others and the immoderate measures that it calls for. What is the evidence for this? How do we know that hl'b'n> (((‘shocking crime’) describes graver, more serious sins than its weaker or more generic synonyms?...
\dfnotes The sacrilege frame is similar to other types of sin frames. There are two main differences from the usages of most other evaluative terms for sin. The standards violated are worthy of greater respect and the effects are more extreme. 0.0.1	SynonymsOur focus term (hAlAbèn ‘scandalous crime’) is related to Hebrew words for sin, horror, disgrace, and outrage. For instance, HALOT defines hM'v; as ‘horrific, atrocious event (always referring to destruction following judgement)’. Both hAlAbèn ‘scandalous crime’  and hM'v; (‘atrocious destruction’) refer to events that cause horror. But, while hAlAbèn refers to horrific criminal acts, hM'v; (‘atrocious destruction’) refers to horrific acts of desolation, often as punishment for criminal acts. While hAlAbèn ‘scandalous crime’ refers to the kinds of events that call for swift judgment, hM'v; (‘atrocious destruction’) refers to the acts of judgment themselves that are called for by serious crimes. The causative relationships may be shown like this:hAlAbèn ‘scandalous crime’ > horror > judgment > hM'v; ‘atrocious destruction’ > more horror0.0.2	Contrasting Focus of SynonymsThe term hAlAbèn ‘scandalous crime’ perspectivises the extreme reaction of outrage to the sinful event. It refers to a crime that ought to cause public outrage and a drastic response. |bTerm 	Gloss		Focusajx	|b*		none[vp			intention of agent: deliberate (therefore, culpable)!w[				consequence for agent: culpability and punishmentlw[			agent: unexpected act by formerly righteous agent~va  			effect on agent: guilt @nx 			effect on agent: moral impurityhb'[eAT			effect on others: disgusthAlAbèn 			effect on others: outrageetc.

\syntagcc 1. Fixed expression: ‘to commit a scandalous crime in Israel’     Meaning: ‘to commit such a shocking crime that it ought to outrage every law-abiding citizen throughout the whole nation of Israel’. It refers to the people of Israel, not to the land of Israel. (Cf. REB for Gen 34:7: ‘done what the Israelites hold to be an intolerable outrage’.)     Function: It emphasises two things about such crimes: (1) they offend the public conscience of the nation as a whole, causing a nation-wide outcry and (2) the whole nation is implicated in the crime and must be purged by getting rid of the perpetrators from among them (cf. Deu 22:21; Jos 7; Jdg 19-20). |nH|n*dden:}	More…    Variant forms: 2 Samuel 13:12 has two alternate forms of the fixed expression: (1) ‘Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don’t cause such a scandal’. (2) The perpetrator is warned that he would become ‘a scandalous fool (|inabal|i*) in Israel’ (that is, the people of Israel would despise him as a scandalous fool).     Distribution: All occurrences of the first contextual use, except for the special case of hyperbolic paronomasia (1Sa 25:25). None of the second contextual use, except Jeremiah 29:23, where its double application refers not only to the lying words the false prophets spoke in God’s name, but also to their adulterous acts.2. Wordplay: ‘He lives up to his name. Scoundrel is his name, and scandal is never far from him’ (1Sa 25:25).     Meaning: This is an exceptional use of the noun. Nabal’s offence, though serious enough in a culture that values hospitality so highly, did not outrage the whole nation. The term seems somewhat excessive to describe his stinginess.     Function: But the exaggeration may be deliberate, serving to placate David’s anger, which is Abigail’s main purpose. Her wordplay on Nabal’s name also serves to appease David by making him feel that his anger is justified. 	More… on NIDOTTE and Phillips 19753.

\eval ‘…the men of the town will take the woman to the door of her father's house and stone her to death.This woman brought evil into your community by sleeping with someone before she got married, and you must get rid of that evil by killing her.’ (CEV)CEV renders the fixed expression as ‘brought evil into your community’. This conveys part of the significance of the fixed expression. But since this aspect is already represented elsewhere in the verse, it is better at this point to emphasise the extreme offensiveness of the crime - one that should cause an outrage throughout all Israel. Unlike other modern translations, however, the CEV unambiguously shows that the fixed expression properly refers to the people of Israel, not to the land of Israel.REB renders the fixed expression as ‘committed an outrage in Israel’ (cf. ESV). This accurately portrays the idea of scandal, as does a noun like ‘infamy’ (NJB and TOB). GW’s ‘godless act’ may not always evoke the idea of public scandal for all English speakers, but it is better than the following. Several other translations are only a little astray by employing adjectives such as ‘disgraceful’ (NIV, NRSV, NLT, NCV, EIN) or ‘shameful’ (TEV, NJPS). Those that use ‘folly’ (LXX, RSV, NASB) are far from signifying the horrific enormity of the offence. See Is ‘folly’ an adequate translation equivalent?

\eval 'The LORD was angry with his people and kept punishing them, because they had turned against him. They were evil and spoke foolishly. That's why he did not have pity on their young people or on their widows and orphans.’ (CEV)Many English translations still use terms like ‘folly’ (KJV, NRSV, NAB), ‘foolishness’ (NASB, GW), ‘foolishly’ (CEV) and ‘madness’ (NJB). Exceptions include ‘impiety’ (REB, NJPS), ‘evil’ (TEV) and ‘lies’ (NLT and NCV). But the guilt of the Israelites in Isaiah’s time was far greater than foolish lies would cause. Their scandalous words were no mere slips of the tongue or insignificant blunders, made because they were ignorant and foolish.

\gloss altar
\freq 403
\sub זבח
\intro 1. This word refers to an elevated physical structure dedicated to the worship of a deity.2. The elevated structure was a platform made of packed earth, piled stones, cut stones, wood overlaid or plated with a metal such as bronze or gold, or metal. The Israelites were not permitted to build an altar of cut stones (Exo 20:25).3. The structure was normally used as a stand for burning animal sacrifices or cereal offerings. An altar could also serve as a memorial marker, or as a place of refuge. The word also referred to a stand for burning incense.4. The structure was high enough to allow the officiator to work on it while standing at its base. In some cases, the structure was built in stages that required the officiator to mount steps to be able to work on it. The people of Israel were forbidden to build such altars (Exo 20:26).5. In the Old Testament, the word most frequently refers to the altar of burnt offering which stood in the tabernacle or temple just before the entrance to the sanctuary. This altar was eventually promoted as the only legitimate place to offer animal sacrifice and cereal offerings to the God of Israel. In the tabernacle, this altar was made of acacia wood overlaid by bronze. The temple altar is referred to as the bronze altar, but it is not clear whether it was made entirely of bronze or of wood overlaid with bronze.6. The word, especially when used in the plural, can refer to altars for pagan worship, such as for the worship of Baal.7. The word can also refer to the altar of incense which stood in the sanctuary of the tabernacle or the temple and served as a brazier for burning incense. In the tabernacle this was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. In the temple, it is sometimes referred to as the gold altar.8. In certain contexts, an altar was built as a memorial marker, not as a platform for burning sacrifices or incense. In addition to serving as a platform for burning sacrifice or incense, it also served the function of a place of refuge from vengeance killing in cases of manslaughter.
\tnotes Care needs to taken when translating 'altar' in Tazi contexts. Any large animal killed for food is ritually 'sacrificed' and it is done on a floor set apart for that purpose. So a substantive referring to 'place of sacrifice' usually refers to a floor where a butcher works. It bears no resemblance to the physical structure of Old Testament altars and does not suggest an object used for worship.In traditional Christian contexts, churches of liturgical background may included a raised structure that is called an 'altar'. But care must be taken in these cases, as well. There are valid metaphorical comparisons between a Christian altar and the kinds of altar that were used in  Israelite worship. But in terms of actual form and function there are very significant differences. It would be helpful to the translator to look for pictures or diagrams of Old Testament altars in Bible dictionaries or handbooks before they decide on the proper description or designation of an altar in their translation.
\hebraist |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* is a noun derived from the verb |hזבח|h* 'to slaughter, to sacrifice' using a |hם |h*preformitive . Such nouns 'are mainly abstract nouns, nouns of place and nouns of instrument' (Joüon and Muraoka 1993; §88Ld). In the vast majority of occurrences, |hמִזְבֵּח|h* is not abstract, but is referring to a concrete structure. However, an altar is a place of sacrifice.
\comp All occurrences of |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* make reference to a physical structure. The primary function of the structure was to provide a platform for burning sacrifices and offerings. This primary function is clear in the first three meanings. Meaning 1 refers to altars that were built by the patriarchs in a variety of places, in a practice that was continued well after the development of the official cult centered around the altars in  the Tabernacle and the Temple, especially in the Northern Kingdom. A contextual use distinction was made for the altar that was built on Mount Ebal at the time the Israelites entered the land. It functions as both a place of sacrifice and as a memorial to the covenant law that had been established between God and the people while they were in the desert.Meaning 2 refers to the bronze altar that was a focus of official worship when the Tabernacle and later the Temple were established and the priesthood was instituted. Contextual uses were distinguished for the different altars in the Tabernacle and the various versions of the Temple. In addition, these altars could serve as a point of refuge and become references for expressions that refer to the activities of priesthood or congregational worship.Meaning 3 refers to altars that were dedicated to pagan gods. One contextual use is distinguished where the altar in Bethel is personified as the focus of guilt for northern kingdom's apostacy and as a result is punished.Meaning 4 refers to the altar that was built by the eastern tribes following the conquest. The western tribes interpreted its function as that of sacrifice. The eastern tribes insisted that it was built only as a reminder. The western tribes accepted that explanation which indicates that 'memorial' was an understood secondary function of a patriarchal style altar.Meaning 5 refers to the incense burner that was built for the Tabarnacle and the Temple. It did not function as a place of sacrifice, but the burning of incense was probably viewed as analagous to the burning of the animal sacrifices and cereal offerings, allowing the term 'altar' to be extended to refer to 'the altar of incense'.
\dfnotes The word 'altar' evokes the frame of Sacrifice and that frame unites all of the meanings even if only by analogy in the case of Meaning 5.  Though the frame is the same throughout, domains of patriarchal religion, priesthood, pagan religion, memorial, and purification rituals distinguish the various meanings of the word.

In the case of Adonijah the altar is not specifically named. In the case of Joab, it is the altar in the Tabernacle (the tent of the LORD). So, it seems likely that Adonijah also fled to the altar in the tabernacle.

\eval In the Hebrew the prophet adresses the altar: 'Altar! Altar!' and the rest of prophecy refers to the altar in the second person. Most of the translations translate the personification literally. However, in a language where the personification is unnatural or misunderstood, it would be possible to follow the CEV. It removes the personification and changes the reference from 2nd person to 3rd person.

\meaning An altar built as a memorial marker to the God of Israel, not as a platform for offering sacrifice.
\frame Sacrifice
\domain Memorial
\syntagc An altar is prototypically understood as place of sacrifice. But it could also serve as a memorial marker. Such a function is implicit in many of the contexts for Meaning 1. The altars are build on locations of significant interaction with God, often there is no mention of sacrifice being made, and one of the functions may be to remind those who follow of what happened. Exodus 20:24 refers to the altar as a "place where I cause my name to be remembered" (RSV). But the only place where an altar's function as a memorial marker is asserted and distinguished from its function as a place of sacrifice is in Joshua 22. In this passage, it is clear that the function as a place of sacrifice is what comes to mind when the western tribes hear that the eastern tribes are building their own altar. But they accept the eastern tribes assertion that the altar is only to serve as a memorial.

\eventfr Event =to burn incenseAgent =High PriestPatient =incenseBeneficiary =High PriestLocation =headword
\syntagc No sacrifice is done on the altar of incense. It is probably referred to as an altar because the burning of incense and the going up of its smoke is comparable to the burning of a sacrifice and the going up of its smoke. In addition it is comparable in shape, being square in its cross-section with upturned corners, called horns. It is likely that the burning of incense was viewed as analogous to the burning of a sacrifice.The actual function of the incense burned on the altar is not clearly described. In Exodus 30:7,8, the high priest is to offer incense on the altar when he goes into the sanctuary every morning and evening to take care of the lamps. In Leviticus 16:12-13, when the high priest enters the sanctuary to sprinkle blood on the covenant box, he is to bring in coals and incense, and burn the incense on the fire (the word 'altar' is not actually used in this instance). 'The smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so that he will not die' (Lev 16:13, NIV). Nielsen comments 'This incense cloud provides the high priest with cover against the divine wrath or the divine “radiation.” The incense smoke gives protection.'|nr|n* Another way to put this is to say that the incense smoke establishes holiness.

\not (i) Numbers 23 tells the story of Balak enlisting Balaam to curse the Israelites. God responds to Balaam and speaks through Balaam. So, one could question whether it is appropriate to group these occurrences under pagan altars. But Balak didn't associate Balaam with the God of the Israelites, nor does Balaam try to correct Balak. God used Balaam in spite of his adherence to pagan practices.

\sub קַנָּא, קִנְאָה
\intro |hקנא|h* means to become angry in response to a challenge to one's honour.1) A person can provoke another to anger by challenging their honour;2) A person can be provoked to anger by what other people do that is perceived as a challenge to one's honour;3) A person can experience anger about someone else who represents a challenge to their honour, even though the other person does nothing to provoke the anger;4) A person can be provoked to anger in behalf of someone else whose honour has been challenged.
\tnotes Traditional English translations of |hקנא|h* use terms such as 'to be jealous' or 'to envy'. They are often misleading because they evoke the Frames of Hatred, Ownership, or Desire rather than the Frames of Anger and Honour / Shame. In some contexts such as Numbers 5, 'to be jealous' might be an appropriate translation, but in many others, English translations of 'jealousy' or 'envy' make little sense. More modern English translations use general words, like 'passion' or 'to be passionate'. In so doing they evoke the emotional intensity of |hקנא|h* but they don't help the reader to understand the reason for the intense emotion. The reason for the intense emotion would have been clear to a Hebrew speaker. |hקנא|h* is an understandable, but not always appropriate, response to an honour challenge. The OT understands this response well, but is ambivalent about whether it is always a desirable response.Because |hקנא|h* evokes two Frames and there is no comparable term in English, it is often necessary to use two or more words to carry the same semantic content. The translator would be wise to explore the semantic domain of Honour / Shame as well as Anger within the audience culture. If honour, and avoidance of shame, is a high value, then there may be a cultural equivalent of an agressive response to someone who challenges one's honour. If not, the KTBH translations offered here may provide helpful suggestions.
\hebraist The verb is found in the Piel stem (30x) and in the Hiphil stem (4x). The Hiphil stem expresses a causative relationship (someone causes someone else to become angry). In two occurrences the syntax and context indicates that the Piel stem should be understood as causative (Deu 32:21 and 1Ki 14:22).
\comp All of the meanings and uses described below evoke the same cognitive scenario: B challenges the reputation or honour of A A is threatened with shame. A |bexperiences anger|b*. A expresses that anger and attempts to reestablish his or her reputation. |hקנא|h* refers specifically to the experience of anger but brings to mind the whole scenario.There can be variations on the scenario. The challenge to honour may be attributed to the actions of a group or type of people, or it may be a more general state of affairs. The challenge to honour may be intentional or unintentional. In some cases, B does nothing to create a challenge; A simply feels threatened by B's status or reputation. Finally, B may challenge the reputation of C, but it is A that feels the anger on behalf of C. Protecting the reputation of someone else happens due to the close relationships between patrons and clients in Ancient Near Eastern social order.Different aspects of the scenario are brought into focus by how the scenario is expressed grammatically and these affect the nuance of meaning of the expression.Meaning 1: When a causative form is modified by a |hבְּ|h* prepositional phrase, B causes A to experience |hקנא|h* |iwhen|i* B does certain things. Meaning 2: When a non-causative form is intransitive and modified by a |hבְּ|h* prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* |iwhen|i* B does certain things or |iwhen|i* certain things are done. Meaning 3: When a non-causative form is transitive and there is no |hבְּ|h* prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* about B though B has done nothing to provoke a challenge.Meaning 4: When a non-causative form is intransitive and is modified by a |hלְ|h* prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* on behalf of C (B's role as an Agent is left implicit).Contextual Uses are distinguished either by changes in the participants or by special contextual domains that are brought to mind. So, in Meanings 1 and 4, separate contextual uses are distinguished depending on whether God or humans are Experiencers of |hקנא|h*. Meaning 4 also has distinctions in contextual use depending on whether God or humans are Benefactives. In Meaning 3, different contextual uses are distinguished by whether the Honour challenge is in the context of rivalry for status or in the context of adultery.
\dfnotes |hקנא|h* evokes two Frames: Anger and Honour / Shame. It is used regularly in association with words for anger. The writer of Proverbs classifies it as a form of anger. Anger is an emotional response to a threat to a person's well-being. Various contexts indicate that when |hקנא|h* is used the anger is in response to a threat to a person's honour or status.

\keyverse They |bchallenged the honour|b* of their God and provoked him to anger by worshipping idols and serving in their sanctuaries. (KTBH)
\eval RSV provides a traditional translation: 'For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they |bmoved|b* him |bto jealousy|b* with their graven images'. But the English word 'jealousy' does not naturally lead the reader to think of honour and shame. CEV reads: 'God |bdemanded all their love|b*, but they |bmade him angry|b* by worshiping idols. (CEV)' The CEV avoids the word 'jealousy'. Its use of the phrase 'God demanded all their love' may be meaningful for an English audience, but it evokes the domain of marriage which is only a small part of the use of the word, |hקנא|h*. It may actually be misleading for non-Western languages which have a vocabulary for honour and challenges to honour. The KTBH translation makes the frame of Honour / Shame explicit in the translation and allows the anger word in the parallel line to carry the frame of Anger. It also rearranges the parallelism to make the cause and effect order more apparent. The parallelism could be retained by translating: 'They provoked God to anger by serving in sanctuaries of other gods; they |bchallenged his honour|b* by worshipping idols'.

But in modern English, jealousy evokes the frames of possession or selfishness, not that of honour. It is possible to reframe a challenge to honour as an attempt to shame.

\eventfrc (Agent: human, implied by the scenario = the wicked man)Experiencer: human = the wise personStimulus: the context which indicates the challenge to honor = the way of life of the wicked man
\syntagcc In the wisdom literature, |hקנא|h* looses some of the intensity of its anger. Anger may turn inward and become bitterness or frustration. But the sense of an honour challenge is still there. Wealth or success contributes to honour. And wicked men are often successful or wealthy. Such success challenges the honour of the wise man (Psalm 73:3). The wise man is tempted to become angry and embittered (Psalm 37:1; Proverbs 24:19). Most English translations use 'envy' to translate |hקנא|h* in these passages. It is possible that bitterness leads the wiseman to desire to imitate the 'successful' ways of the wicked (Proverbs 3:31, 24:1) and that is what is being expressed in these passages. But these would be unusual uses of the word. All of these passages make sense if |hקנא|h* is understood as an emotion leading to suppressed anger, or bitterness.

\keyverse For I |bfelt shamed|b* by the arrogant, |bbitter|b* when I saw that their wickedness made them prosperous. (KTBH)
\eval The RSV reads: 'For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked'. Arrogance is a negative quality. So, it is not at all clear why a person would be envious of the arrogant, since it would imply that the psalmist is attracted to the arrogant. But that makes no sense in the context. The KTBH translation tries to bring out the comparison the psalmist is making between his own life and that of the arrogant. They seem to have prospered and been honoured, while he has suffered and been dishonoured. He wonders whether he has lived a wise life in vain (see verse 13).

\syntagcc In both of these passages the object of the prepositional phrase is a person. But the use of the preposition indicates a different realization of the scenario than if the person is the simple object of the verb (see Meaning 3). In both instances the context indicates that the Effector has definitely provoked the anger of the Experiencer by challenging the honour of the experiencer. In the case of Leah the provocation was intentional. In the case of Joseph it was probably not intentional but the result of being naïve.

\keyverse Rachel had not borne Jacob any children. She was |bshamed|b* by this and |bprovoked to anger|b* by her sister. She said to Jacob: "Give me sons or I will die!" (KTBH)
\eval RSV translates: 'When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!"' The word 'envied' seems weak in light of the context. CEV translates: 'Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, “I'll die if you don't give me some children!”' This translation indicates the intensity of Rachel's emotion, but 'jealousy' doesn't carry a sense of provocation. The phrase, 'She saw that she had not borne Jacob any children', hints that Rachel perceived that her infertility had become a public talking point. As a result, she was shamed and responded to her sister's provocation with anger, directed at Jacob. Jacob's reaction to Rachel's implicit slight of his honour is anger in response to anger.

\eval Many versions translate 'great' as 'wealthy', which is a legitimate translation in this context. For an English-speaker that then makes sense of the translation of 'the Philistines envied him'. But it doesn't help explain the Philistine reaction. Rather than try to appropriate his goods, they disable his wells and ask him to leave the region (following translations like NIV, TEV, CEV). 'To be great' is 'to have honour' and the Philistines were threatened to the point of anger in comparison to him. So they shamed him and made him leave the region.

\eval |i'Are you jealous on my account?|i*' (NJB) is an unusual use of the word 'jealous'. Jealousy is a selfish emotion in modern English. It would make more sense to use 'zealous' but it is too scholarly for modern English translations. TEV's '|iAre you concerned about my interests?|i*' comes closer to the meaning of the Hebrew word but emasculates the emotional content. The KTBH translation helps to identify Joshua's chief concern, the honour of his partron, and gives a sense of the emotional intensity of the word. Finally, a Why question is much more a rhetorical rebuke in English than is a Yes-No question. Context clearly indicates that Moses intended it as a rebuke.

However, TEV uses a sort of double negative ('to not tolerate any rivals') which actually gives a negative connotation to the expression. Since tolerance is a very high positive value in Western cultures, to suggest that God isn't tolerant may be seen negatively. The author's translation tries to states Phineas' reaction in a positive manner.

\not (a) The Hiphil participle is modifying the phrase 'the idol of jealousy' and is usually translated as a relative clause 'the idol of jealousy which provokes to jealousy'. The expression is figurative. The idol isn't the Agent of provocation, since it is an inanimate object. Rather it is those who make or worship the idol that provoke God to anger. So, a possible translation would be: '...where the shameful idol stands. Those who worship it provoke God to anger. (KTBH) The advantage of such a translation is that it evokes both the frames of Anger and Honour / Shame, and it avoids the redundancy of a literal translation.

\intro |hקִנְאָה|h* refers to the experience of becoming angry or anxious in response to a challenge to one's honour.1) A person can provoke another to anger by challenging their honour;2) A person can experience anger or anxiety in response to a challenge to honor;3) A person can be provoked to anger in behalf of someone else whose honour has been challenged.
\tnotes Traditional English translations of |hקִנְאָה|h* use terms such as 'jealousy' or 'envy'. They are often misleading because they evoke the frames of ownership, possessiveness, or selfishness for an English speaker, rather than the frame of honour or reputation. In some contexts such as Number 5, 'jealousy' might be an appropriate translation, but in many others, English translations of 'jealousy' or 'envy' make little sense. More modern English translations use general words, like 'passion'. In so doing they evoke the emotional intensity of |hקִנְאָה|h* but they don't help the reader to understand the reason for the intense emotion. The reason for the intense emotion would have been clear to a Hebrew speaker.The translator would be wise to explore the semantic domain of honour/shame within the audience culture. If honour, and avoidance of shame, is a high value, then there may be a cultural equivalent of an agressive response to something that challenges one's honour. |hקִנְאָה|h* is an understandable, but not always appropriate response to an honour challenge. The OT understands this response well, but is somewhat ambivalent about whether it is always a desirable response.
\hebraist |hקִנְאָה|h* is an abstract noun formed from the verb |hקנא|h*. It expresses the event of being provoked to anger over a challenge to honour or the state of being angry due to an honour challenge. It can be absolute noun, the head of a construct phrase, or a construct noun itself. It is only modified by an adjective twice, both times in Zechariah by the adjective |hגָּדוֹל |h*(1:14, 8:2). It can serve as the object of the preposition |hב־|h* (5x), and of the preposition |hכ־|h* (1x). It can be modified by a personal possessive pronoun. In all cases the possessive pronoun refers to the experiencer of the emotion. When |hקִנְאָה |h*is the head of a construct phrase the noun in construct may refer to the experiencer (c.f., Ecclesiastes 4:4), or to the beneficiary of the emotion (c.f., Psalm 69:10). Context determines whether the pronoun should be understood as experiencer or beneficiary.  |hקִנְאָה|h* only occurs in the plural in Numbers 5 where it is a part of two different technical terms: 'offering of jealousies' or 'ritual of jealousies'.

The author's translation attempts to do so. In addition, it brings out an insight evident in BFC that |hגבר|h* in the |ihitpa'el |i*may refer to defying someone, see also HALOT.

\keyverse then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a cereal offering of jealousy, a cereal offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance. (RSV)...because it is an offering from a suspicious husband, made to bring the truth to light. (TEV)
\eval The RSV is quite literal and ignores the secondary sense of the |ihiphil |i*of |hזכר|h* (to remember). It can mean 'to make known' (HALOT). That's clearly the meaning of the word in this context. The offering and the ritual that goes along with it are designed to determine whether or not the wife is guilty of adultery and so to relieve the husband of his anxiety that his honour has been defiled by his wife. TEV corrects that misunderstanding and is very idiomatic.

When all this happens, you will be convinced that I, the LORD, have spoken to you because I am outraged at your unfaithfulness. (TEV)...because I am outraged at the shame that you have brought on me. (author's translation)
\eval The TEV provides an interesting translation. They assume that |hקנא|h* is drawing on the metaphor of adultery. That is not a necessary understanding, if one understand the frame of honour and shame. The disobedience of a client would challenge the honour of the patron.

\intro The verb |hבין|h* expresses a large continuum of mental activities with respect to an object. The verb can be intransitive, transitive and causative, but the difference does not always show up in the morphology. To put it more simply, not every hif'il expresses a causative. Its meaning range is as follows, in ascending order of mental participation:1. To observe with active participation of the mind     a. to notice, to take note of    b. to consider attentively, to pay heed to    c. to pay positive and/or respectful attention to someone or something    d. to see though the outward appearance of things: to understand something, to have/gain insight into   something; to conclude    e. to |iact|i* in a way that shows insight and discernment    f. to be able to perceive and see through the outward appearance of things, to have a discerning mind    g. to be capable of performing an activity; (more specifically) to be skilled in a profession    h. to examine, to check2. (Causative) To provide someone with discernment and understanding of something; to teach, explain something to someone    a. to explain something to someone in order to convince him    b. to explain Scripture to someone    c. to provide someone with (divine) understanding (regarding something)
\hebraist According to the grammars Gesenius-Kautzsch-Cowley (73a) and Joüon-Muraoka (54f; 81d) the usual and old form is |hהבין|h* ; hence the imperfect |hיבין|h* is a Hifil. The forms that morphologically cannot be but Qal forms are probably secondary hypercorrections, since the Hifil had acquired a causative meaning, which it originally (with respect to |hבין|h*) did not have.

\keyverse NIV84 - [I] came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.
\eval This use of the verb is closest to mere 'seeing'. It involves a minimal exertion of the mind. For example, if you see a herd of sheep you may |inote|i* a billy-goat among them. You were not really looking for that goat, but you simply notice it, which means that you activate your knowledge of the differences between goats and sheep. In CEV Neh 13:7 reads 'I found out'. This is less appropriate because it suggests investigation on Nehemia's part.

(pp. 401-402, likewise Durham, Exodus (WBC) ad loc.).From these definitions we should rather translate the terms as, respectively: knowledge, insight/understanding, expertness.
