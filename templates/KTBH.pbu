\intro The only distinction in meaning is between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist The Qal and Hithpael are used without obvious difference in meaning. The former, normally, and the latter, consistently, express the target with בְּ.

\intro 1. There are two Hebrew words with the same form. One of them is a noun meaning either ‘anger’ or ‘nose, nostril, face’. The other is a particle meaning ‘also, even, indeed’.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist There is unanimous agreement that the particle אַף and the noun are homonyms (BDB, HALOT, DCH, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT). Equally there is agreement that the two meanings of the noun, 'nose, nostril' and 'anger', are related. The original meaning of the root אנף and the precise nature of the relationship between the meanings of אַף, however, are less certain.In some cases, the connection becomes explicit where other Hebrew words for 'anger' collocate with אַף used in the sense 'nose'. TDOT cites Ezk 38:18 and Psa 18:8-9, noting that 'in the OT the nose plays a certain role in the description of anger' (1.351). Similarly in Isa 65:5, 'these people are smoke in my nose' implying that they are a source of irritation and anger.One suggestion is that אנף may originally have meant 'to snort' and thus form a link between 'nose' and 'anger' but this is not universally accepted (TDOT 1.351).

\dfnotes For notes see other synonyms. In addition:It may be helpful to distinguish positive and negative frames for divine anger:For the positive frame, the domain related to the stimulus event is apostasy, and that related to the consequence frame is judgement.For the negative frame 'turning from anger' the domain related to the stimulus event is repentance, and that related to the consequence frame is mercy.The negative frame is often expressed by a construction with |hשׁוב|h*, either with the verb in the Qal and |hאַף|h* as subject, often with a |hמִן|h* phrase of the former target, (x18), or with the verb in the Hiphil and God as subject (x5).Alternatively, it may be expressed by the Hiphil of |hנוח|h* with |hחֵמָה|h* as object, 'God gave rest to his anger'.

\keyverse KTBH - Then he speaks to them in his |banger|b*, and in his fury he terrifies them
\eval Most translations use two of the available English synonyms for the two Hebrew synonyms in the parallelism - 'anger, wrath' (NIV), 'anger, fury' (TEV), 'anger, rage' (NJB, NJPS) or 'wrath, fury' (RSV, NRS). These are all good models, though, perhaps, since |hאַף|h* is the most common of the Hebrew synonyms, and 'anger' is the most common in English, 'anger' might be the best choice. REB renders the prepositional phrase 'in his anger' by the adverb 'angrily' which may also be followed. CEV renders the verse rather freely, 'The Lord becomes furious and threatens them'.

\sub זַעַם
\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning for the verb is between ‘to curse’ or ‘to be angry’. Note that the noun from the same root refers only to anger.2. For the Meaning 'to curse', there is a further distinction in meaning between God cursing someone, Meaning 1a, and someone cursing someone else, Meaning 1b.3. For the Meaning 'to be angry', there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry at someone, Meaning 2a, and someone being angry at someone else, Meaning 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist The relationship between this noun and its cognate verb requires specific comment. The noun collocates frequently with words for 'anger', whereas the verb does not. In Num 23:7-8 and Pro 24:24, the verb collocates instead with words meaning 'to curse'. The relationship then may be that, for the verb, the meaning shifts from 'to be angry' > 'to speak in anger' > 'to curse', whereas for the noun, the meaning 'anger' dominates.

This seems a better model to follow than TEV which reverses this 'anger, indignation' (CEV is similar), because it seems better to match the more common and more general words in the translation.

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone being physically unwell or emotionally upset and showing it, Meaning 3.2. The one instance of Meaning 2 refers to the violence of the sea, behaving as if it were angry (cf Meaning 1).
\hebraist Most of the instances of |hזעף|h* and its cognates occur in contexts where the meaning 'anger' is appropriate. A few, particularly Gen 40:6 and Dan 1:10, cannot have that meaning, leading some to propose two homonyms. |hזעף|h* I 'to rage, be angry' is well attested in cognate languages, but the existence of |hזעף|h* II is debated. HALOT, TDOT and NIDOTTE all defend homonym II by citing an Arabic root|i ḍaʿif|i* 'look wretched, pitiful, dejected' though TDOT notes that |iḍ |i*does not correspond to Hebrew |hז|h*.BDB maintains a single root with a central meaning 'be out of humour' which develops in two directions 'be dejected' and 'be enraged' corresponding to the two main meanings presented here.

Others recognise that the raging is a property of the sea and translate 'the raging sea' (NIV), the raging of the sea' (REB). 'Rage' is a good rendering because the English and Hebrew match, though this may not be possible in other languages. TEV conveys the meaning without the word 'rage': '[the sea] calmed down' (CEV similar). Depending on translation style, any of these would be a good model to follow.

\syntagc The term זעף expresses a response to an incomprehensible dream in one case, and a change of diet in the other. In neither case is anger appropriate to the context. The fact that Joseph saw that something was wrong suggests that the word refers to something visible. Joseph's reference to the men's faces being רָעִים 'sad' also supports the element 'and to show it' in the definition. In a similar way, Nebuchadnezzar would have observed a problem.

All fit the context well and all are consistent with the evidence for meaning.

\altint The majority view (HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE) is that the adjective is derived from |hזעף|h* I and has the sense 'angry'. It is worth noting, however, that |hזעף|h* II, with the sense 'out of humour, dejected' would also fit.

\intro 1. Most instances of the word refer to anger or to the heat of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. In a few instances, the word has other meanings, perhaps related to heat. One is ‘poison, venom’, Meaning 2a, and another is heat from wine, Meaning 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist חֵמָה is generally agreed to be derived from יחם, though חמם and יחם are closely associated roots and there is even some doubt over which of the two roots gives rise to some of the Qal forms.חמם means 'to be hot' in various senses, and יחם also means 'to be' hot', but in a more limited sexual and reproductive sense. This sexual and reproductive sense, however, is not attested for חֵמָה. Its most common sense is 'anger', though it occurs a few times in the senses 'poison, venom' and 'heat from wine'. As TDOT notes, 'the notion of "being hot" ... probably furnishes the point of departure for all three meanings'.

\eval A problem here is the two words for 'anger' in the parallel cola. Most use two English synonyms: 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB), 'anger, fury' (NJPS) or 'anger, heat of wrath' (NJB). Use of the neutral 'anger' for the common אַף is natural, but care is necessary for the other word to avoid wrong connotations. 'Wrath' is little-used except for God's wrath, but may be the best choice. 'Fury' conveys intensity and is appropriate for a temporary anger, which is not a settled attitude. CEV collapses the parallel cola  without loss of meaning and thus needs only one word 'anger'. This may also be followed.

\gloss to burn [with anger]
\freq 93
\intro 1. Most instances of the word refer to burning with anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word means ‘anger’, There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. In a few instances, the word has other meanings. One is ‘to be worried or distressed’, Meaning 2a, another is ‘to compete’, Meaning 2b, and a third is ‘zealously’, Meaning 2c.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist Other ANE languages have a cognate root which has the meaning 'to burn' in a literal sense. This suggests that the literal meaning may also have been present in Hebrew, but in the Hebrew Bible the root only occurs in metaphorical senses, particularly 'to burn with anger'. It does however, collocate with literal fire, both in narrative (Num 11:1) and in poetry (2Sa 22:8-9, Psa 18:8-9).Other verbs עבר 'to burn' (Psa 2:12, Isa 30.27) and עשׁן 'to smoke' (Deu 29:19, Psa 74:1) also take אַף (and other words for anger) as subject, though less often than חרה and their literal meaning is more prominent.  חרה is unique, however, in that the literal sense is unattested.Of the two main constructions of the Qal,|na|n* one makes the anger explicit, 'someone's anger burned', and the other is an impersonal construction in which the anger is implicit, 'it burned to someone' = 'someone was angry'. The latter construction is also attested in Hebrew for other emotions.|nb|n* There appears, however, to be little or no difference between the two constructions. The fuller expression is used for most instances of Yahweh's anger, but not consistently. The shorter expression is more common for human anger, but both occur.
\evalev HALOT proposes a second homonym, attested only at Isa 24:6. The Westminster Hebrew Institute, in their morphological database, however, follow the majority of authorities (BDB, NIDOTTE, GKC, Even-Shoshan) against HALOT and considers the form חָרוּ, found at Isa 24:6, to be derived from the root חרר 'to burn'.

\dfnotes See other synonyms for notes. In addition:1. 'Then David was angry because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzzah' (2Sa 6:8, NIV, similarly REB) is an informative mistranslation. The Hebrew makes Yahweh the subject of the verb |hפרץ|h*, but NIV makes Yahweh's anger into the subject, thereby demoting Yahweh in terms of the actor-undergoer hierarchy, and presenting him as being driven by his own anger. Others follow Hebrew more closely, making Yahweh the agent of the 'breaking out'.2. It is the event-type of the associated events that determines the domains involved. For example, for divine anger, the stimulus is typically apostasy and the consequence is judgement.

\gram There are two main constructions (see further the Comments for Hebraists), one of which makes the anger explicit, 'someone's anger burned', and the other is an impersonal construction in which the anger is implicit, 'it burned to someone' = 'someone was angry'. Whichever occurs in the Hebrew, the same translation options may be used (see Evaluation or Translations).

\intro 1. All but one instance of the word refers to the burning of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word refers to ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b. 3. In Psa 58:10, the meaning is very uncertain, Meaning 2.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist For discussion of the likely original sense 'burning' of the root see the cognate verb |hחרה|h*. Although the term is never used of literal burning,|na|n* it is used in contexts in which literal burning is a consequence of God's anger (eg Lam 4:11).In a similar manner to the verb, there are two constructions, the more common in which |hאַף|h* 'anger' is explicit, God's |hחֲרֹון אַף|h*, and the less common in which it is implicit, God's |hחָרֹון|h*. There appears to be little or no difference in meaning between the two constructions.

\eval Most retain the 'burning' imagery and understand the construct pair |hחֲרֹון אַף|h* as an intensifying construction, 'burning anger' (RSV, NRS, REB, NJB) or 'blazing anger' (NJPS). This works well in English and could be followed in other languages where it is natural. NIV mutes the imagery, but is otherwise similar, 'fierce anger'. It may be appropriate to use an intensifying adjective with a basic word for 'anger' in this way. Others simplify the expression to 'indignation' (TEV) or 'be furious' (CEV).

\hebraist For discussion of 'burning' as the probable original sense of the root, see the discussion of the cognate verb |hחרה|h*.Unlike the verb and the cognate noun |hחָרֹון|h*, only one construction is found in HB, that in which |hאַף|h* 'anger' is explicit, someone's |hחְָרִי אַף|h*. Six instances, however, provide inadequate evidence that the alternative, without |hאַף|h*, cannot occur.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone experiencing anger, frustration etc, Meaning 1, and someone causing someone to else experience the anger etc, Meaning 2.2. Another distinction which requires care in translation is the nature of the response. The verb has a wider range of meaning than some other anger terms. It is used for responses which include frustration, Meaning 1c, and fear, Meaning 2c, as well as anger, Meanings 1a and 1b. Sometimes it may be wise to translate with a neutral word like the English ‘to provoke’.3. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The two instances of the Piel both collocate closely with the Hiphil. Either they describe the same sequence of events (1Sa 1:6-7) or they connect two similar events (a cause and its effect; Deu 32:21). Both stems signal a causative meaning. The distinction is stylistic, not semantic (TDOT: 'the very rare piel appears to represent a stylistically motivated variant to a nearby hiphil').2. The cognate noun (see כַּעַס) collocates with the verb, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction eg בְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה ‘because of the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).3. The majority of instances of this root are spelled with ס, but in the book of Job, it is spelled consistently with שׂ. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. TDOT and NIDOTTE suggest that the spelling with שׂ may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate.

\dfnotes With a few exceptions the meanings of כעס all relate to the same frame, labelled simply ‘anger’ in which the elements are: 	the anger event itself	an experiencer of the anger	an event which is the stimulus for the anger	an agent who instigates that event and may be described as the agent which causes the anger	a target of the anger who is normally the same as the agent	consequence event(s) of the anger having an impact on the targetMeaning 1 points to the anger event itself, while for Meaning 2 the focus is the event which is the stimulus for the anger.Subsequent research might show that it would be better to deal with two sub-frames, divine anger and human anger, which would relate to different domains in different ways. Alternatively, since, at least some of the time, the anger of a man of God is expected to match that of God, the sub-frames might be righteous and unrighteous anger.Perhaps because anger is such a common human experience, the anger frame is evoked in many contexts so that the frame is understood against a background of many domains. Thus there are no core domains, only non-core. For example:	Wickedness: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Idolatry: God's anger is provoked by idolatry	Injustice: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Unbelief: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the unbelief of Israel in the wilderness	Prophecy: a prophet provoked the anger of an ungodly king	Judgement: God's anger against the target was expected to have punishment as a consequence

\eval It is important to distinguish the response from anger. Most translations appropriately use a generic translation, eg 'I will trouble' (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV) or 'I shall cause disquiet' (REB). CEV's 'nations will be shocked' may capture more precisely the nature of the response which God provokes, as indicated in v. 10. However, its use of a passive, perhaps for stylistic reasons, reduces the force of nineteen first person singular verbs in twelve verses in the Hebrew, which emphasise what Yahweh will do. NJPS's use of ‘vex’ (its normal equivalent for |hכעס|h*) implies anger, which is out of place here. Similarly, 'grieve' (NJB) slightly misreads the response.

\not (c) Probably. Following Williamson (WBC, 1985:214, 217) and some modern translations (eg NLT, ESV, RSV), KTBH assigns Nehemiah 3:37 to Meaning 2a and recommends making God the explicit Experiencer whose anger is being provoked. Fensham (NICOT), TDOT and other modern translations (eg NIV, NRS, NJPS, NJB, NAB and REB), however, interpret the preposition in ְנֶגֶד הַבּוֹנִים 'in front of the builders' as signalling the people provoked rather than the witnesses of the provocation. Although TDOT favours God as the implied Experiencer for each of five other instances listed below, it rejects this interpretation in the case of Nehemiah 3:37. Evidence for this view includes Sanballat's ridicule of the Jews (v. 33), which may point to the 'builders' as the Experiencers (Use 2b). Arguments against this position include:1. It would involve a unique use of this preposition and Williamson (WBC, 1985:214) sees this as 'an insuperable difficulty'. 2. In five other instances God is the implied, but unexpressed, Experiencer of the Hiphil of כעס (1Ki 21:22; 2Ki 21:6; 2Ki 23:19; Hos 12:15; Psa 106:29). 3. Nehemiah's request earlier in the same verse 'do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from before you' may imply some offence against God, which would provoke His anger.A third possibility (not followed in any translation) may be indicated by the context of the previous few verses (33-36), where it was Nehemiah and his associates who were being provoked (in the hearing of the builders).

\not (d) In the relationship between Hannah and Peninnah, Hannah’s emotional response would have been complex and mixed, but is likely to have included both anger and grief. Even without Penninnah’s malicious provocation, Hannah would have been experiencing grief, shame and jealousy, simply because of her childlessness and the constant presence of a rival wife. That provocation must have introduced something new to the mixture of negative emotions. As a response to provocation, probably in the form of taunting as several versions suggest, it may best be described as anger.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between the anger, grief etc which someone experiences, Meaning 1, and what causes someone to experience the anger etc, Meaning 2.2. Another distinction which requires care in translation is the nature of the response. The noun has a wider range of meaning than some other anger terms. It is used for responses which include grief, Meaning 1c, and frustration, Meaning 1d, as well as anger, Meanings 1a and 1b. Sometimes it may be wise to translate with a neutral word like the English ‘provocation’.3. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*) collocates with the noun, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction e.g.|hבְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה|h* ‘with the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf. 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).2. The majority of instances of the root are spelled with a |hס|h*, but in the book of Job, the spelling is consistently with |hשׂ|h*. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. It is suggested that the spelling with |hשׂ|h* may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate (TDOT, NIDOTTE) or that it is a dialectal variation (BDB, TWOT).3. Unlike the cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*), the participants are, for the most part, not closely linked syntactically to the head word. Some are vague, especially in the Wisdom literature (see below), but generally they can be recovered from the wider context and a knowledge of the frame involved.
\comp 1 Focus: response	a Experiencer: God; response: anger; target: human	b Experiencer: human; response: anger; target: human	c Experiencer: human; response: grief; target: none	d Experiencer: human; response: frustration; target: futility2 Focus: provocation	a Experiencer: God; response: anger	b Experiencer: human; response: anger
\dfnotes For notes on the ‘anger’ frame, see this section in the entry for the cognate verb.The Contextual Uses of Meaning 1 are closely related since anger, grief and frustration are closely related experiences. The Specific Frame listed is, in each case, a sub-frame of the more generic 'stimulus - negative response' frame. The main points of distinction between the sub-frames concern the nature of the emotions and the reactions they cause, but they may also be distinguished on the basis of differences in participant roles.The ‘grief’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by the absence of a target. Otherwise, the corresponding elements are present:	the grief event itself	an experiencer of the grief	an event which is the stimulus for the grief	an agent who may instigate that event	a consequence event - weeping etcThe ‘frustration’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by an impersonal instrument causing the frustration and absence of an agent 	the frustration event itself	an experiencer of the frustration	an event which is the target for the frustration - in Ecclesiastes it is the futility of life and toil. In the causing event, this is an abstract instrument rather than a personal agent.
\addinfo The Wisdom writings sometimes leave participants unexpressed and very general (eg the target in Ecc 7:9 and the experiencer in Pro 27:3). It is the knowledge of the 'anger' frame that enables the reader to recognise that there must be an experiencer and a target in each case.

It seems undesirable to weaken the force expressed by ‘anger’ in this way.

\keyverse KTBH - My eye has wasted away from |bgrief|b*; it has grown weak because of all my foes
\eval Most translate by 'grief' (RSV, NRS, REB) or 'sorrow' (NIV, CEV). This seems appropriate because the effect on the psalmist's eyes is likely to be from weeping. The use of 'vexation' by NJPS and NJB points to anger rather than grief, so should be avoided. TEV ‘I can hardly see; my eyes are so swollen from the weeping caused by my enemies’ makes the weeping explicit and points unambiguously to grief, though it does not have a direct equivalent to |hכַּעַס|h*.

A subjective genitive ‘provocation by his sons' would be readily understood. Other translations transform the noun into a verb and thereby convey the same meaning eg 'because he was angered by his sons and daughters' (NIV). Several translations reconstruct the verse to achieve a smoother reading eg NRS, 'The LORD saw it, and was jealous; he spurned his sons and daughters.' It is not clear, however, whether this is a decision to follow the emendation proposed in BHS or whether it is a matter of translation technique.

\not (b) In the phrase כַּעַס אוֹיֵב ‘the provocation of an enemy’, the 'enemy' could be either a subjective or an objective genitive. A subjective genitive would imply that the enemy was the Experiencer. However, the enemy’s misunderstanding and false claim that it was they who had defeated Israel (v. 27b) would constitute provocation to Yahweh (cf Craigie, NICOT). In this respect, the construction is similar to several instances of the Hiphil of the cognate verb כעס where Yahweh is the unexpressed Experiencer.Thus KTBH takes the Experiencer to be Yahweh and the enemy to be the Agent and assigns this instance to Use 2a.

\not (e) English translations differ in their treatment of this instance of |hכַּעַס|h*. NIV, NRS and REB translate ‘grief’ (cf KTBH Use 1c); CEV and TEV are similar. RSV, NJPS, NJB and also WBC translate ‘vexation’ (cf KTBH Use 2b). The difference appears to be whether |hעָמָל וְכַעַס|h* are seen as cause and effect ‘trouble [which causes] grief’ or as synonyms ‘mischief and provocation [which together provoke anger]’.Since the Psalm focuses on the activity of the wicked, it seems better to take both |hעָמָל|h* and |hכַּעַס|h* as describing that activity, rather than the response of the victim. KTBH thus classifies this instance as Use 2b, ‘something which provokes anger’.

\intro 1. This is a very common word, often meaning ‘to pass over, to pass by, to pass through‘ in a literal sense. Instances of this meaning are listed briefly without analysis as ‘Other meanings’, Meaning 4.2. Certain instances of the term, marked by the Hebrew verb form, have a different meaning and mostly refer to anger.3. When the meaning is anger, the key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2a. 3. Meaning 3 is distinguished in Pro 14:16, where the word refers to arrogance. Compare Meaning 2 of the cognate noun. Elsewhere it refers to anger.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist Most authorities recognise two homonyms for עבר (BDB, HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT), but express some uncertainty about their relationship to one another and to the noun עֶבְרָה. BDB seems to imply an etymological link from עבר I (mostly Qal and Hiphil) 'to pass over' to עֶבְרָה '[overflowing of] anger, arrogance' to עבר II (Hithpael only) 'to be arrogant, furious'. HALOT proposes a link to an Arabic root meaning 'to be nasty' and TDOT appears to refer to the same Arabic root 'be malicious, malice, rancour, resentment'. Only the Hithpael, assumed to be from homonym II is treated here as a key term.

\eval Apart from TEV 'God was angry', most translations express some intensified form of anger. Thus, 'very angry' (NIV), 'full of wrath' (RSV, NRS), 'enraged' (REB, NJPS), 'furious' (CEV). These are all acceptable models, but it is hard to justify intensifying the anger, unless the Hithpael form is taken to imply, in itself, intensification.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between the majority of instances of this word which refer to anger, Meaning 1, and a small number which refer to arrogance, Meaning 2.2. When the meaning is anger, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.

\frame Anger
\gram The plural occurs three times (Job 21:30; 40:11; Psa 7:7) without obvious difference in meaning. It may be a plural of intensity (cf Jouon and Muraoka 136.f, GKC 124.e) or, at least at Job 40:11 and Psa 7:7, it could indicate a repeated series of actions or a habitual behaviour 'outbursts of anger' (HALOT, cf IBHS 7.4.2.c, VDM 24.3.3.v).

\eval Most translations use 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB, NJB), for the two Hebrew synonyms in the parallelism. This is a good model, since 'wrath' is acceptable when God is the experiencer. However, TEV and CEV choose a less old-fashioned alternative from among the range of available English synonyms, 'anger, fury' (TEV, CEV). NJPS uses 'ire, wrath', but 'ire' is probably too archaic to be used.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist In this analysis, the Qal expresses a state ‘be angry’ or a process ‘become angry’ while the Hiphil expresses a causative ‘make angry’ in accord with the prototypical senses of the respective stems. Traditional Hebrew lexicography reached the same conclusion, distinguishing a stative Qal (BDB: ‘be wroth’ and HALOT: ‘be angry’) from a causative Hiphil (BDB: ‘provoke to wrath’ and HALOT: ‘to rouse to anger’), though their glosses may have relied too much on the morphology.

\eval Most translations use some variation on the word 'anger': 'was angry (NIV, REB, NJPS), 'became angry' (TEV), 'was angered' (RSV). Any of these is a good model to follow. NRS uses 'wrathful' which is acceptable for divine anger. CEV assumes a causal relationship between the first two clauses of the verse and combines them, 'You had made the Lord angry'. This loses too much of the Hebrew and should not be followed. NJB combines the second and third clauses, making the second into a prepositional phrase, 'in his anger swore ...'. This may be followed if it is more natural in the receptor language.

\not (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its meaning from that of the Qal.
\notfr (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its lexical meaning from that of the Qal. BDB may be overinfluenced by the morphology in giving an explicitly reflexive gloss ‘put oneself in a rage’ and Young goes even further, ‘The people will work themselves into a frenzy, exciting themselves to anger‘ (1965:321). If the prototypical reflexive nuance of the Hithpael is present, it may make the people responsible for their own state, ‘they work themselves into a state,’ but HALOT 'fallen into a rage' lacks a reflexive nuance.The Hithpael does, however, also differ slightly in its event frame from the Qal, in that it is a force, distress and hunger, which causes the anger and the target of the anger is the king and their god(s). This different event frame might imply a slightly different nuance. The prototypical link between what causes the anger and its target is broken, so both the anger and its experiencers are less rational. [Note for future research, to be confirmed or rejected: in the ancient Hebrew worldview, if there are no uncaused events, then anger at king and god may be the natural response to distress and hunger.]There is an additional problem here in establishing the Target. In the next clause the phrase  'the king and their god(s)' is governed by |hבְּ|h*. This is unusual with |hקלל|h*, which normally expresses the Target of the curse with an accusative, and the rare instances of |hבְּ|h* (1Sa 17:43) or |hבְּשֵׁם|h* (2Kg 2:24) point to the God or gods invoked to enforce the curse (cf BDB, HALOT). For this reason, most commentators understand the cursers to invoke their king and their gods (WBC, Young, TOTC, KD, but not NICOT). By contrast, most translations take 'the king and their God/gods' to be the Target of the curse and therefore also the anger (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV, NJB). To do otherwise would leave both cursing and anger without any Target, so KTBH recommends following the majority of translations.The final problem is whether or not the God/god(s) who is cursed is Yahweh. Translations and commentaries are divided on the issue, but the occult involvement in v. 19 suggests that ‘their god(s)’ is no longer Yahweh and the translation should not have an upper case G.
\notsp (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its lexical meaning from that of the Qal. BDB may be overinfluenced by the morphology in giving an explicitly reflexive gloss ‘put oneself in a rage’ and Young goes even further, ‘The people will work themselves into a frenzy, exciting themselves to anger‘ (1965:321). If the prototypical reflexive nuance of the Hithpael is present, it may make the people responsible for their own state, ‘they work themselves into a state,’ but HALOT 'fallen into a rage' lacks a reflexive nuance.The Hithpael does, however, also differ slightly in its event frame from the Qal, in that it is a force, distress and hunger, which causes the anger and the target of the anger is the king and their god(s). This different event frame might imply a slightly different nuance. The prototypical link between what causes the anger and its target is broken, so both the anger and its experiencers are less rational. [Note for future research, to be confirmed or rejected: in the ancient Hebrew worldview, if there are no uncaused events, then anger at king and god may be the natural response to distress and hunger.]There is an additional problem here in establishing the Target. In the next clause the phrase  'the king and their god(s)' is governed by |hבְּ|h*. This is unusual with |hקלל|h*, which normally expresses the Target of the curse with an accusative, and the rare instances of |hבְּ|h* (1Sa 17:43) or |hבְּשֵׁם|h* (2Kg 2:24) point to the God or gods invoked to enforce the curse (cf BDB, HALOT). For this reason, most commentators understand the cursers to invoke their king and their gods (WBC, Young, TOTC, KD, but not NICOT).

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning is between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.2. In Hos 10:7, an etymologically unrelated word of the same form is used in the sense ‘something of little value or significance’, Meaning 2.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The general view is that Meaning 2 is taken from a homonymous root found in the HB only as nouns. The masculine form |hקֶצֶף|h* occurs only at Hos 10:7 (see below), and the feminine form |hקְצָפָה|h* only at Jol 1:7, where it has an abstract sense 'snapping, splintering' (BDB) or 'literally snapped, in particular of damage from breaking off twigs or branches' (HALOT).2. The noun in Meaning 1 is used with the verb twice in a cognate accusative construction (Zec 1:2, 15).

\notxx (e) Probably.The Experiencer and even the Target of the anger are far from certain. The commentaries construct scenarios in which they suggest the Stimulus and Experiencer of the anger. For details, see the commentaries, but, in outline, possibilities are:1. Yahweh was angry with Israel for driving Moab to such extreme measures as human sacrifice to Chemosh (KD).2. Israel was angry with itself, taking |hעַל|h* in the sense 'with', for the same reason and left the battle in disgust (WBC, AB and, among translations, REB, CEV, NJB).3. Moab was stimulated by the sacrifice to great anger and effective warfare (WBC).They are all speculative and none is totally convincing, but KTBH considers that Yahweh as Experiencer is less plausible than one or other of the human Experiencers.Other translations are non-committal and leave the Experiencer vague (NIV, RSV, NRS, NJPS).

\intro 1. Although there are only few instances of literal, physical shaking or trembling, that seems to be the central meaning of the word-group. Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts and the trembling may be metaphorical, internal or emotional.2. The main meaning distinction is between that literal, physical shaking or trembling, Meaning 1, and metaphorical or internal shaking as a result of a negative emotion, Meaning 3.3. A second key meaning distinction is between someone or something trembling, for whatever reason, Meanings 1 and 2, and someone making someone or something else tremble, Meanings 3 and 4.4. There are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The nature of that emotion can be established from the context.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\comp Although there is only one instance of literal, physical shaking or trembling (1Sa 14:15), that seems to be the central meaning of the word-group (cf TDOT). Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts. In the context of theophany, heaven and earth tremble. Elsewhere, human trembling results from intense emotion - fear, anger, grief or excitement. In some cases, there may be associated physical trembling but, in others, that disappears from view and the trembling is metaphorical, internal and emotional.1 Stem: Qal; agent: none; theme: subject	a Theme: inanimate; context: earthquake	b Theme: inanimate, but personified; context: theophany2 Stem: Hiphil; agent: subject; theme: object	a Agent: God; theme: inanimate, but personified; target: none; context: theophany3 Stem: Qal or Hithpael; agent: none; experiencer: subject	a Experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	b Experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	c Experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	d Experiencer: human; target: human or God; context: anger	e Experiencer: human; target: none; context: grief	f  Experiencer: human; target: none; context: excitement4 Stem: Hiphil or Qal; agent: subject; theme or experiencer: object	a Agent: God or human; experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	b Agent: human; experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	c Agent: human; experiencer: human; target: none; context: disturbance

These are all good models to follow. CEV appears to have assumed a hendiadys and renders the pair by 'trembled'. This is also a good model to follow.

\eval Most render the Hiphil of |hרגז|h* by 'I will make ... tremble' (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV) or 'I shall make ... shudder' (REB). In NJB 'I am going to shake the heavens', 'shake' is transitive and thus causative. All these convey the causation and the lexemes are good equivalents. Any of them may be followed. NJPS transforms to a passive 'therefore shall heaven be shaken'. Although the unexpressed agent is understood to be Yahweh, there seems no reason to follow this example.

\gram The Hithpael occurs only in the parallel passages in 2KI 19:27-28//Isa 37:28-29, which have no parallel in 2 Chronicles. There is insufficient evidence to justify a distinction of meaning, although BDB tries to indicate a reflexive nuance by glossing 'excite oneself', which seems artificial. HALOT makes no attempt to indicate a reflexive nuance, glossing 'to get worked up, be enraged'.

\keyverse KTBH - Yahweh will rise up as at Mount Perazim; as in the Valley of Gibeon |bhe will be enraged|b* ...
\eval The translations show considerable variation in this verse because the cause of any trembling is far from clear. Some make a nuance of anger explicit 'be wroth' (RSV), 'rage' (NRS), 'storm with rage' (REB). NJB 'he will storm' probably also conveys a nuance of anger. Except for RSV which is archaic, these may be followed.'Rouse himself' (NIV, NJPS) provides a good parallel for |hקום|h* in the first colon, but does not correspond well to |hרגז|h*. Some expression of Yahweh's attitude is needed. TEV and CEV collapse the two cola into one and have no direct equivalent to |hרגז|h* and also lack the nuance of anger.

\keyverse KTBH - |bBe angry|b*, but do not sin...
\eval The translations show great variation in this verse because the cause of any trembling is far from clear. LXX renders |hרגז|h* by |gὀργίζω|g*, and this is taken up in the NT which quotes this verse at Eph 4:26. This may have influenced NIV and RSV who translate 'in your anger' and 'be angry' respectively. These models may be followed.REB 'let awe restrain you from sin' and TEV 'tremble with fear' understand the context to be 'fear', probably implicitly, fear of God. This also may be followed.CEV and NJPS 'tremble' leave the cause ambiguous. This is a legitimate option if the translation style does not try to spell out implied information.

\keyverse KTBH - The king |bwas trembling with grief |b*and he went up to the room ...
\eval The context is clearly one of grief, but translations differ in whether they focus on the trembling, either physical or internal, or on the grief. Thus TEV makes the grief explicit 'was overcome with grief' but at the expense of any nuance of motion, whereas CEV 'started trembling' does not make clear that the trembling arises from emotion and, in English, trembling is not conventionally associated with grief. RSV, NRS and REB render 'was deeply moved'. This is a good model to follow, because it conveys the nuance of motion present in the Hebrew imagery, makes clear that the motion is internal and emotional and allows the contest to make clear that the emotion is grief. It is better than 'was shaken' (NIV, NJPS) which is less clearly arising from emotion.

\eval The irony of this passage is that the King of Babylon has become just like the shades in Sheol, and they are excited at the prospect of gloating over the one who oppressed them in life. Most render |hרגז|h* in a way that conveys that excitement, 'all astir' (NIV, REB), 'stirred up' (RSV, NRS). These models may be followed. Even CEV 'eagerly awaits' which renders four words in the Hebrew conveys the excitement. TEV 'getting ready' is weak and loses the sense of excitement, so it should not be followed.

NJPS conveys the intensity of the emotion, using 'anguished', while others specify it 'anxious' (NIV, similarly TEV), unquiet (REB). Since it is hard to be precise about the nature of the emotion, any of these may be followed.

\intro 1. This form of the root is particularly difficult to classify and the scheme below should be taken as tentative.2. The main meaning distinction is between literal, physical shaking or trembling, Meaning 1, and metaphorical or internal shaking as a result of a negative emotion, Meaning 2.3. There are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The nature of that emotion can be established from the context.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\altint This form of the root is particularly difficult to classify and the scheme below should be taken as tentative. If the root is accepted as meaning 'to tremble' then that sense can be detected in some cases, but is largely absent for others. Thus a war-horse may tremble with excitement when held back before battle, but in Contextual Use (d) the sense has been lost, as with the English words 'agitation, disturbance, turmoil'.

\not (a) The assignment of Hos 4:7 to Meaning 2 presupposes that the MT is followed as suggested in HO TTP and that 'their glory' refers to an attribute of the priests. An additional factor in favour of the assignment of Hos 4:7 to Meaning 2 is the fact that elsewhere in the book (Hos 9:11; 10:5), |hכָּבוֹד |h*is used to refer to an attribute of an item. This interpretation (Meaning 2) is followed by TEV, CEV, RSV, NJPS, and others. Several translations (NIV, NJB, and others) follow a variant text that has a different form of the verb |hמור|h* and interpret 'their Glory' as a name for God. (See the discussion of this verse in WBC.) If this interpretation and textual variant are followed, then this occurrence of |hמור|h* in Hos 4.7 would be assigned to Meaning 1.

\sub מֶכֶר, מִמְכָּר, מִמְכֶּרֶת
\intro 1.  The verb |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ is used most frequently to refer to a commercial transaction that involves the sale of an item (including humans) to another human for a price. 2.  Selling an item involves a change of ownership and control. 3.  These elements of ownership and control allow for the extended usage of the verb מכר ‘to sell’ to refer to God's causing Israel to be defeated in battle (Meaning 2a) and his sending them into exile (Meaning 2b). In addition, the verb מכר ‘to sell’  can be used metaphorically for the rejection of a positive moral value (Meaning 4) and for submitting oneself totally to doing evil (Meaning 3).The final extended meaning (Meaning 5) is uncertain, but seems to refer to the person who is enslaving or exploiting others by a variety of means.
\comp The five meanings of |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ can be basically divided into two groups. Those occurrences that refer to a literal commercial transaction (Meaning 1) and those that are extensions of Meaning 1 (Meanings 2-5). Meaning 1.  The basic event (focus: the commercial transaction) Meaning 2.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 3.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: control) Meaning 4.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 5.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: control)
\dfnotes 1. In Meaning 1 humans sell various items including other humans. This usage triggers the Commercial Transaction frame and the sell sub-frame. The Commercial Transaction frame is used against the background of a variety of domains depending on the item being sold. This includes the Slavery domain and one occurrence that is best understood against the background of the Marriage domain. 2. In Meaning 2, YHWH is selling His people and this use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. One of the background cognitive domains necessary to make this correct interpretation is the 'YHWH is a king' metaphor that is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. YHWH is like a king who has made a treaty with the people of Israel - one that obligates both parties to fulfill certain requirements. When Israel breaks this agreement, by not fulfilling their obligations, then YHWH has the right to respond accordingly. In the context of a king's responsibilities towards his subjects, ‘disown’ means ‘relieve oneself of the responsibility to protect’ which in turn means ‘allow their enemies to defeat them’. The purpose is to punish them for their rebellion. 3. In Meaning 3, a person is selling himself to the control of evil. This use of the verb triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame. This meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Pagan Religions, Evil, and Sin.  A person submits to the control of evil by participating in pagan activities such as divination, child sacrifice, and augury. All of these activities are viewed as evil by God. 4. In Meaning 4, a person is encouraged to not sell truth. This metaphorical use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. This usage is best understood against the background of the Wisdom/Folly domain. Wise people are those who buy (acquire possession of) truth and do not sell (disown or reject) it. 5. Meaning 5 is uncertain, but it seems to refer to an entity that is enslaving or exploiting another by the use of various kinds of evil activities. This extension of Meaning 1 seen in the participle triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame and focuses on the agent of the activity. This extended meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Exploitation, Slavery, and Evil. An entity (the city of Nineveh who is spoken of as a harlot) causes the Israelites to submit to her control (ie sells them) by means of various evil activities.

\eval NRS is an acceptable translation of a verse whose specific meaning is uncertain.  Versions vary widely in their translation of this verse, but none of the 8 translations consulted translated מכר ‘to sell’ literally. The main grammatical difficulty in translating this verse is determining the semantic functions of בִּזְנוּנֶיהָ ‘through her debaucheries’ and בִּכְשָׁפֶיהָ ‘through her sorcery’. In most verses with מכר ‘to sell’ the preposition בּ ‘with’ is used to refer to the instrument for which an item is sold, e.g., ‘for twenty pieces of silver’ (Gen 37:28). In at least one verse, the preposition בּ ‘with’ indicates the reason the sale was made, i.e., ‘for your sins’ (Isa 50:1). If the first interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations so that she would be able to commit adultery and magic as a result of the sale. If the second interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations because of her adultery and magic. Most translations follow neither of these interpretations. Instead, the phrases are interpreted as the means by which the nations are enslaved or trapped, as in CEV and other versions -- ‘You were nothing more than a prostitute using your magical charms and witchcraft to attract and trap nations’.

Both are acceptable choices, but property is probably the more commonly used term for land.  REB uses the phrase ‘legal possession,’ which is probably more a translation of the context than of the word |hמִקְנָה|h* ‘purchase’.

\eval Most English translations use a verbal phrase ('he had bought') with or without a literal translation of the word 'its silver'.

\keyverse If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption a larger share of the |bprice |b*paid for him. (NIV)
\eval 'The longer the time until then, the more you will have to pay.' (CEV) English translations generally use the term 'price' to translate this meaning of the term. The difference between this meaning and Meaning 1b, may be seen in a comparison of the meaning and the translation of the construct chain מִקְנַת כַּסְפֶּךָ 'purchase of your silver' in Gen 17.12 and the construct chain כֶּסֶף מִקְנָתוֹ 'silver of his purchase' in Lev 25:51. In the first, the focus is on the fact that the slave (Item) was purchased with money. In the second, the focus is on the amount of money (Price) involved in the purchase. In Lev 25:51 the term מִקְנָה ‘purchase’ is translated by terms such as ‘(price) paid for him,’ (NIV, RSV) ‘pay’ (CEV), ‘purchase (price)’ (NRS, TEV, NJPS) ‘sale-price’ (NJB), ‘(sum) for which he sold himself’ (REB). All of these translations are basically adequate.

\intro The term |hרְכוּשׁ|h* 'possessions' refers to items that have been acquired by a particular person by one of a variety of means.  These items are then under that person's ownership. |h   |h*
\comp There is only one meaning for |hרְכוּשׁ|h* 'possessions'.
\dfnotes In 2 Chronicles 35:7, |hרְכוּשׁ|h* is used as a summary term that includes all kinds of animals in herds and flocks as well as other possessions such as silver, gold, other costly items, and storage buildings with grain, wine, and other produce.

\eventfr Event: to acquireAgent: humanPatient: thing
\syntagc The word |hרְכוּשׁ |h*does not appear to include human beings (Gen 14:16, 21). It does, however, sometimes include animals (Gen 36:7). At other times, |hרְכוּשׁ|h*   appears to refer to items in addition to or other than certain types of animals that are listed separately (Gen 46.6). Hence |hמִקְנֶה|h* can be in both a part-whole relationship with |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e., possessions including livestock, and it can also be the opposite of |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e. livestock and NOT possessions. Some examples may be interpreted in at least two different ways. For instance, the phrase |hלִבְהֶמְתָּם וְלִרְכֻשָׁם וּלְכֹל חַיָּתָֽם׃|h*may be interpreted as referring to two coordinated items that are exclusive of each other and both of these two items are included in the all living creatures category. A second interpretation is that each of these three terms refers to distinct referents that are exclusive of the other two items. In this interpretation, the term |hחַיָּה|h* would refer to other animals that are neither cattle nor possessions, i.e., wild animals.

\intro 1. This word refers primarily to priests serving God in the Tabernacle and the Temple.2.  It is also used for other priests of God and for priests of pagan gods.3.  In a few cases it refers to a special relationship with God.4.  In three places where the meaning is sometimes understood as 'royal adviser', KTBH prefers to understand a reference to an unofficial priesthood.
\tnotes 1. The role of a |hכֹּהֵן|h* is very different from that of the leaders of Christian congregations (see 'New Testament' below). Therefore it is inappropriate to translate this word with a term which is used primarily for Christian leaders.2. Uses 1b and 1d refer to the single High Priest, who had special functions. But this role was not clearly defined during the early monarchy period. In translation, a special word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be used when the Hebrew word is qualified by |hגָּדֹול|h* or |hרֹאשׁ|h*. When the Hebrew is simply |hכֹּהֵן|h* but the reference is to someone elsewhere identified as High Priest, the word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be appropriate, but other prominent named priests should not be assumed to be the High Priest.3. The leaders (plural) of the priests mentioned at 2 Chronicles 36:14 and Ezra 8:24, 29; 10:5 should be distinguished from the singular High Priest; a rendering like 'chief priests' may be misleading.4. |hכֹּהֵן|h*, and Aramaic |hכָּהֵן|h*, is related to the Arabic word |ikāhin|i*, which has been borrowed into other languages. The meaning in Arabic is rather different from the Hebrew, more like 'diviner', but in some other languages this word is used in the sense 'priest' and so may be an appropriate rendering of |hכֹּהֵן|h*.
\hebraist The noun |hכֹּהֵן|h* may be understood as the participle of the otherwise unknown Qal form of the verb |hכהן|h*.
\nt The Greek equivalents of |hכֹּהֵן|h*, |gἱερεύς|g*, also |gἀρχιερεύς|g* 'High Priest, chief priest', are used in the New Testament almost entirely of Jewish priests, and only once of pagan priests (Acts 14:13). They are used of Jesus Christ only in Hebrews. They are also used three times in Revelation (1:6; 5:10; 20:6; cf. |gἱεράτευμα|g* 'priesthood' 1 Peter 2:5,9) of all Christian believers; these uses allude to Exodus 19:6, and so relate to Meaning 3 below and bring out the idea of a priest as an intermediary between people and God but with no sacrificial function. But they are nowhere used as a specific term for Christian leaders, who did not offer sacrifices; their relationship with other Christians should not be compared to that of Jewish priests with other Jews.

\dfnotes |hכֹּהֵן|h* is a cultic term. The great majority of its uses refer to those charged with leading worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple. A smaller number relate to other worship of God and to worship of pagan gods. Just a few times the word is used to indicate a special relationship with God.The analysis of this word and of its cognates is based on an understanding that in Hebrew thinking there were several distinct domains of worship. These are distinguished by different settings, regulations, associations, and sequences of events, and by the biblical authors' different attitudes towards them. Therefore a distinction is made here between Worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple, Worship at local shrines (i.e. authorised worship led by Levites), Unofficial Israelite worship of God (including worship not authorised by the Law of Moses), Non-Israelite worship of God, and Worship of pagan gods. The precise distinctions between these domains are unclear, and sometimes depend on the different perspectives and evaluations of different biblical authors.The main duties of a priest in the Tabernacle and the Temple were to offer sacrifices. Subsidiary roles included teaching and prayer, and seeking guidance from God. Certain sacrifices could be offered only by the single High Priest. Priests at local shrines also offered some sacrifices, although this is not permitted by the law of Moses; this is why Josiah closed down the local shrines (2 Kings 23:8, 9). The main roles of non-Israelite priests also seem to have been sacrificial.

\not (a) Aramaic references.
\not (b) In this verse |hכֹּהֵן|h* is used in parallel with |hכֹּמֶר|h*, in a way suggesting that two different groups are referred to. The latter word surely refers to the priests of Baal, as in 2 Kings 23:5, and so it seems likely that the former refers to apostate priests of the Temple of God, cf. 3:4. Therefore this occurrence of |hכֹּהֵן|h* is listed under this contextual use.
\not (c) Aramaic |hעֲבִידָה|h*.
\not (d) The references listed here are only those in which the priests relate to the instruction or law as guardians or instructors.
\not (e) The High Priest is only sometimes distinguished by the qualifying terms |hמָשִׁיחַ, גָּדֹול, רֹאשׁ|h*. More often he is distinguished from other priests by longer expressions or from the context. Hilkiah seems to have been the first priest given the title |hהַכֹּהֵן הַגָּדֹול|h*, but some earlier priests were known as |hכֹּהֵן הָרֹאשׁ|h*.
\not (f) These named priests are not specifically called High Priest, although some of them seem to have served as such. In the early monarchy period there does not seem to have been a single High Priest; during David's reign Zadok and Abiathar seem to have shared the leading role.Included here are the following references to priests by name:|hאֶלְעָזָר |h*Eleazar (before the death of Aaron): NUM 3:32; 4:16; 17:2,4; 19:3,4|hאִיתָמָר |h*Ithamar: EXO 38:21; NUM 4:28,33; 7:8|hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas, son of Eleazar: NUM 25:7,11; 31:6; JOS 22:13,30,31,32|hעֵלִי |h*Eli: 1SA 1:9; 2:11; 14:3|hחָפְנִי |h*Hophni and |hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas: 1SA 1:3|hאֲחִימֶלֶךְ |h*Ahimelech: 1SA 21:2,3; 22:11; 2SA 8:17; 1CH 18:16|hאֶבְיָתָר |h*Abiathar: 1SA 23:9; 30:7; 2SA 15:35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:7,19,25,42; 2:22,26,27; 4:4; 1CH 15:11|hצָדֹוק |h*Zadok: 2SA 8:17; 15:27,35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:8,26,32,34,38,39,44,45; 2:35; 4:4; 1CH 15:11; 16:39; 18:16; 24:6; 29:22|hעֲזַרְיָהוּ |h*Azariah: 1KI 4:2|hיְהֹויָדָע |h*Jehoiada: 2KI 11:9,9,15; 12:3,8,10; 2CH 22:11; 23:8,8,9,14; 24:2,20,25; and an earlier Jehoiada: 1CH 27:5; and a later Jehoiada: JER 21:26|hאוּרִיָּה |h*Uriah: 2KI 16:10,11,11,15,16|hפַּשְׁחוּר |h*Pashhur: JER 20:1|hצְפַנְיָהוּ |h*Zephaniah: 2KI 25:18; JER 21:1,25,29; 37:3; 52:24|hיְהֶזְקֵאל|h* Ezekiel: EZK 1:3|hעֶזְרָא  |h*Ezra: EZR 7:11,12,21; 10:10,16; NEH 8:2,9; 12:26|hמְרֵמֹות |h*Meremoth: EZR 8:33

\not (i) These references seem to be to a priesthood in Israel predating and separate from the order of Aaron - including in Psalm 99:6 where Moses as well as Aaron is named as a priest.
\not (j) 2 Samuel 8:18 seems to state clearly that David's sons were priests; compare also 2 Samuel 20:26 and 1 Kings 4:5. But this contradicts the law of Moses which allows only descendants of Aaron to be priests. The Levitical priests Zadok and Ahimelech are listed in verse 17. So it is often suggested that here |hכֹּהֵן|h* means not 'priest' but 'royal adviser', as in NIV; compare LXX |gαὐλάρχης |g*'chief of the court'. However, the law of Moses was not obeyed in every detail during the time of David, and the text should not be adjusted to make it appear that it was.In the parallel passage, 1 Chronicles 18:17, the text reads, in place of 'priests', literally 'first to the hand of the king'. It seems probable that the text of 2 Samuel was changed in 1 Chronicles as part of its presentation of David as an ideal king who observed the law of Moses. The LXX translator may have had similar reasons for adjusting the text.In the light of Psalm 110:4, it is possible that David appointed his sons to the priesthood of God Most High who was worshipped in pre-Israelite Jerusalem, i.e. as successors of Melchizedek. (In the light of the New Testament, these sons of David would also be precursors of the greater Son of David who was also called a priest of the order of Melchizedek, Hebrews 6:20.)
\not (k) The text of Hosea 4:4 is commonly emended e.g. to 'for with you is my contention, O priest' (RSV), which implies that the addressee Israel is here being referred to as a priest. But the text as written makes sense, and is accurately translated 'for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest' (NIV). The meaning of this in context is obscure, but the priest referred to here, as elsewhere in Hosea (cf. Amos 7:10 where this is clear), is presumably one of the non-Aaronic priests of the northern kingdom of Israel.
\not (l) In view of v.18 and 1 Kings 16:31, 32, it is assumed that the priests mentioned in 2 Kings 10:11 are priests of Baal, not non-Aaronic priests of God. But it is possible that priests of God are also being referred to here.

CEV 'be a priest' and TEV 'help the priests' are confusing because these people were already priests. RSV and NRSV 'in one of the priest's places' (|isic|i*, with the odd placing of the apostrophe) could be misunderstood as suggesting this person wants to replace another priest.

\intro 1. This word refers to an elevated physical structure dedicated to the worship of a deity.2. The elevated structure was a platform made of packed earth, piled stones, cut stones, wood overlaid or plated with a metal such as bronze or gold. The Israelites were not permitted to build an altar of cut stones (Exo 20:25).3. The structure was normally used as a stand for burning animal sacrifices or cereal offerings. An altar could also serve as a memorial marker, or as a place of refuge. The word also referred to a stand for burning incense.4. The structure was high enough to allow the officiator to work on it while standing at its base. In some cases, the structure was built in stages that required the officiator to mount steps to be able to work on it. The people of Israel were forbidden to build such altars (Exo 20:26).5. In the Old Testament, the word most frequently refers to the altar of burnt offering which stood in the tabernacle or temple just before the entrance to the sanctuary. This altar was eventually promoted as the only legitimate place to offer animal sacrifice and cereal offerings to the God of Israel. In the tabernacle, this altar was made of acacia wood overlaid by bronze. The temple altar is referred to as the bronze altar, but it is not clear whether it was made entirely of bronze or of wood overlaid with bronze.6. The word, especially when used in the plural, can refer to altars for pagan worship, such as for the worship of Baal.7. The word can also refer to the altar of incense which stood in the sanctuary of the tabernacle or the temple and served as a brazier for burning incense. In the tabernacle this was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. In the temple, it is sometimes referred to as the gold altar.8. In certain contexts, an altar was built as a memorial marker, not as a platform for burning sacrifices or incense. In addition to serving as a platform for burning sacrifice or incense, it also served the function of a place of refuge from vengeance killing in cases of manslaughter.
\tnotes Care needs to taken when translating 'altar' in Tazi contexts. Any large animal killed for food is ritually 'sacrificed' and it is done on a floor set apart for that purpose. So a substantive referring to 'place of sacrifice' usually refers to a floor where a butcher works. It bears no resemblance to the physical structure of Old Testament altars and does not suggest an object used for worship.In traditional Christian contexts, churches of liturgical background may include a raised structure that is called an 'altar'. But care must be taken in these cases, as well. There are valid metaphorical comparisons between a Christian altar and the kinds of altar that were used in  Israelite worship. But in terms of actual form and function there are very significant differences. It would be helpful to the translator to look for pictures or diagrams of Old Testament altars in Bible dictionaries or handbooks before they decide on the proper description or designation of an altar in their translation.
\hebraist |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* is a noun derived from the verb |hזבח|h* 'to slaughter, to sacrifice' using a |hם |h*preformitive . Such nouns 'are mainly abstract nouns, nouns of place and nouns of instrument' (Joüon and Muraoka 1993; §88Ld). In the vast majority of occurrences, |hמִזְבֵּח|h* is not abstract, but is referring to a concrete structure. However, an altar is a place of sacrifice.
\comp All occurrences of |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* make reference to a physical structure. The primary function of the structure was to provide a platform for burning sacrifices and offerings. This primary function is clear in the first three meanings. Meaning 1 refers to altars that were built by the patriarchs in a variety of places, in a practice that was continued well after the development of the official cult centered around the altars in  the Tabernacle and the Temple, especially in the Northern Kingdom. A contextual use distinction was made for the altar that was built on Mount Ebal at the time the Israelites entered the land. It functions as both a place of sacrifice and as a memorial to the covenant law that had been established between God and the people while they were in the desert.Meaning 2 refers to the bronze altar that was a focus of official worship when the Tabernacle and later the Temple were established and the priesthood was instituted. Contextual uses were distinguished for the different altars in the Tabernacle and the various versions of the Temple. In addition, these altars could serve as a point of refuge and become references for expressions that refer to the activities of priesthood or congregational worship.Meaning 3 refers to altars that were dedicated to pagan gods. One contextual use is distinguished where the altar in Bethel is personified as the focus of guilt for northern kingdom's apostacy and as a result is punished.Meaning 4 refers to the altar that was built by the eastern tribes following the conquest. The western tribes interpreted its function as that of sacrifice. The eastern tribes insisted that it was built only as a reminder. The western tribes accepted that explanation which indicates that 'memorial' was an understood secondary function of a patriarchal style altar.Meaning 5 refers to the incense burner that was built for the Tabarnacle and the Temple. It did not function as a place of sacrifice, but the burning of incense was probably viewed as analagous to the burning of the animal sacrifices and cereal offerings, allowing the term 'altar' to be extended to refer to 'the altar of incense'.
\dfnotes The word 'altar' evokes the frame of Sacrifice and that frame unites all of the meanings even if only by analogy in the case of Meaning 5.  Though the frame is the same throughout, domains of patriarchal religion, priesthood, pagan religion, memorial, and purification rituals distinguish the various meanings of the word.

In the case of Adonijah the altar is not specifically named. In the case of Joab, it is the altar in the Tabernacle (the tent of the LORD). So, it seems likely that Adonijah also fled to the altar in the tabernacle.

\meaning Altar built as a memorial marker to the God of Israel, not as a platform for offering sacrifice.
\frame Sacrifice
\domain Memorial
\syntagc An altar is prototypically understood as a place of sacrifice. But it could also serve as a memorial marker. Such a function is implicit in many of the contexts for Meaning 1. The altars are built on locations of significant interaction with God, often there is no mention of sacrifice being made, and one of the functions may be to remind those who follow of what happened. Exodus 20:24 refers to the altar as a "place where I cause my name to be remembered" (RSV). But the only place where an altar's function as a memorial marker is asserted and distinguished from its function as a place of sacrifice is in Joshua 22. In this passage, it is clear that the function as a place of sacrifice is what comes to mind when the western tribes hear that the eastern tribes are building their own altar. But they accept the eastern tribes assertion that the altar is only to serve as a memorial.

\eventfr Event =to burn incenseAgent =High PriestPatient =incenseBeneficiary =High PriestLocation =headword
\syntagc No sacrifice is done on the altar of incense. It is probably referred to as an altar because the burning of incense and the going up of its smoke is comparable to the burning of a sacrifice and the going up of its smoke. In addition it is comparable in shape, being square in its cross-section with upturned corners, called horns. It is likely that the burning of incense was viewed as analogous to the burning of a sacrifice.The actual function of the incense burned on the altar is not clearly described. In Exodus 30:7,8, the high priest is to offer incense on the altar when he goes into the sanctuary every morning and evening to take care of the lamps. In Leviticus 16:12-13, when the high priest enters the sanctuary to sprinkle blood on the covenant box, he is to bring in coals and incense, and burn the incense on the fire (the word 'altar' is not actually used in this instance). 'The smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so that he will not die' (Lev 16:13, NIV). Nielsen comments 'This incense cloud provides the high priest with cover against the divine wrath or the divine “radiation.” The incense smoke gives protection.'|nr|n* Another way to put this is to say that the incense smoke establishes holiness.

It is most likely its shape since he describes the table as having the appearance of a wooden altar.

It is not likely that it was meant to be used as an altar of incense or of burnt offering because the wood would not withstand the fire without metal overlay.

\not (m) Context indicates that this is probably the altar in the temple at Bethel. Amos addressed his prophecy to the northern kingdom and mentions the altar at Bethel in prior passages. TEV inserts the word 'the Temple' to help the reader identify that when God 'strikes the tops of the columns' Amos is referring to the columns in the Temple. But it leads to confusion with the Temple in Jerusalem. CEV translates 'the temple altar' but footnotes it with 'The one at Bethel'. De Waard and Smalley (A TRANSLATOR'S HANDBOOK on The Book of Amos, New York, UBS1979, electronic) also identify this with the altar in the temple in Bethel.

\intro 1. Hebrew words for different types of fools (including בער, כְּסִיל, נָבָל ,סכל, פֶּתִי) are not synonymous. 2. The אֱוִיל is a person who is foolish, despises wisdom and even enjoys bad things.3. The word can function both as a noun and as an adjective.4. For the difference with כְּסִיל, see that entry (Comments for Hebraists).
\hebraist If we do not count 2 Ki 24:15 (preferring the |iQere |i*אֵילֵי over the Ketib אֱוִלֵי, this word has 26 occurrences in the OT. Additionally it occurs 4x in Ben Sira. See: Fox M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly" |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15; Bruce Waltke, |iProverbs |i*(NICOT), section (3), 'Two Words for Fool'.For the difference between כְּסִיל 'complacent fool' and אֱוִיל, see the Comments for Hebraists under כְּסִיל.
\comp 1. Frame: Folly; Experiencer: human   1.a. adjective   1.b. noun
\dfnotes One would think that terms in the Folly frame would typically negate terms of the Wisdom frame, but  there are two indications that this is not the case. First, folly terms cannot be mapped as standard negative counterparts of wisdom terms, like 'wise - unwise', 'intelligent - unintelligent' etc. So, it is not the case that e.g. אִוֶּלֶת 'foolishness' would be the standard antonym of חָכְמָה 'wisdom', סִכְלוּת 'folly' the antonym of עָרְמָה 'cunning, astuteness' etc. The Folly frame is mapped along lines that seem to be independent of those in the Wisdom frame. (However, in the book of Proverbs חָכָם 'wisdom' is so often contrasted to כְּסִיל 'complacent fool' that THAT II, 838 speaks of an antitype.)Second, - in fact an illustration of the first point - whereas the Wisdom frame contains a series of nouns that are connected with verbs (e.g. חָכְמָה 'wisdom' with חכם 'to be wise', עָרְמָה 'astuteness' with ערם 'to be cunning, astute' etc.), the Folly frame possesses a series of adjectives and nouns but often lacks corresponding verbs.

\intro 1. The אֱוִיל is a foolish person who, as a result of moral corruption, refuses to make the right moral choices. 2. The moral corruption of אֱוִיל and אִוֶּלֶת is shown by the frequent contrast with words like 'upright' and 'righteous'. 3. The אֱוִיל does not bother to contain his anger or other unproductive emotions.
\hebraist This word occurs also 5x in Ben Sira.Reference: Fox M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly" |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15.
\altint Several Hebrew terms relating to folly are too often rendered as 'fool', 'folly' in English versions. However, a closer look reveals that these terms (including |hבער, כְּסִיל, נָבָל ,סכל, פֶּתִי) are not synonymous. Fox defines אֱוִיל, for example, as 'moral corruption from the standpoint of its impact on judgement and reason'. Accordingly, the אֱוִיל is a person who, as a result of moral corruption, refuses to make the right moral choices. It is thus for good reason that אֱוִיל and אִוֶּלֶת are often contrasted with words like 'upright' and 'righteous'. The fool does not bother to contain his anger or other unproductive emotions.

\intro 1. This verb denotes insolence and disdainful and contemptuous treatment of others.2. There is a homonym, meaning 'to act as an intermediary' (either as an interpreter or as a mediator).
\hebraist The occurrences of לֵץ (occurring another 8x in Ben Sira) and מֵלִיץ have been subsumed under this entry, although some dictionaries (HALOT e.g.) treat them as nouns of its own. The relationship of Meaning 3 to Meanings 1 and 2 is disputed. Some propose a homonym, but others see a common base to all three Meanings, 'to talk freely, to talk big'.References: |iTheologisches Woerterbuch zum AT|i* IV, 567-572; Fox, M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly", |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15.
\altint Traditional English versions render לֵץ as 'mocker' or 'scoffer', but that is misleading, as has already been argued by Buhl in 1913 and by other scholars since (see TWAT IV, 567f.). Why misleading? The main reason is that deriding other people's beliefs and repudiating intellectual principles is not the meaning of this verb. Rather, it denotes insolence and disdainful and contemptuous treatment of others, as LXX has well understood (which interprets it as 'insolence', 'haughtiness'). Fox defines it as 'arrogance manifest as contempt for other people and ideas'.

\eval English versions often offer 'fool' as a rendering, but this only partially covers the desired meaning. Therefore new Bible translations should try to move away from this traditional but inadequate rendering. Alternatives from existing Bible translations include 'villain', 'scoundrel', 'churl'. The English term 'boor' seems a better candidate, but it is not often used (e.g. REB Pro 17:21), probably because it sounds too coarse in the Bible. Nevertheless this term is strong in Hebrew, so it should sound strong in a target language.

\syntagc Nabal's farm is located in Carmel, in the south-east of Judah, and his name probably reflects influence of Arabic dialects in the border regions of Judah. Nabil is a popular name in Arabic to this day. It goes without saying that Nabil doesn't mean 'boor' in Arabic, and that no father would dream of calling his son Boor. But to the Israelite audience the association of Nabal with 'boor' cannot be missed.

\syntagcc The exaggeration that Nabal's conduct is designated by the extreme term |hנְבָלָה|h* (see that entry) may be deliberate, serving to placate David’s anger, which is Abigail’s main purpose.

\eval All English versions transliterate the name as Nabal. But this is a clear case where the author plays on the meaning of the Hebrew word |hנָבָל|h*. Nabal in fact embodies the boor in optima forma; notions of honour / shame, ingratitude, provocation are eminently present. It thus does not comes as a surprise that verse 25 makes this connection explicit. It would be very nice when a language has the possibility to imitate this wordplay. European languages do not offer this possibility.

\intro 1. The term נְבָלָה indicates a flagrant violation of the most revered standards of morality.2. It can be defined as a wanton brutish act towards someone or a wanton brutish disregard of something.3. The doer of נְבָלָה lacks any sense of honour and shame.4. An important element in the meaning is: extremity, i.e. the enormity of the crime, its extreme offensiveness.5. It provokes public outrage and God’s indignation, resulting in extreme responses and actions.
\evalev BDB defines this noun as ‘disgraceful folly (wanton deed)’. HALOT also gives two meanings: ‘stupidity, folly’ (1Sa 25:25; Job 42:8) and ‘wilful sin, sacrilege’. HALOT’s analysis of this word is a significant improvement on BDB’s, but it still retains the idea of folly in two instances. Yet there is nothing in the context of these two instances that would necessarily prevent the scandal frame from being evoked, albeit with some elements behaving as weaker implicatures. Despite the weaker implicatures, the offences referred to by this expression are far more damaging and shocking than mere ‘disorderly conduct’ or ‘folly’. Nevertheless, in Deu 32:6 the related noun נָבָל is contrasted to חָכָם, which signals that the Wisom/Folly frame is certainly present.

\dfnotes This word belongs, together with others, in the overachring Sin frame. There are two main differences from the usages of most other evaluative terms for sin. The standards violated are worthy of greater respect and the effects are more extreme. 1.	SynonymsOur focus term (|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’) is related to Hebrew words for sin, horror, disgrace, and outrage. For instance, HALOT defines |hשַׁמָּה|h* as ‘horrific, atrocious event (always referring to destruction following judgement)’. Both |hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime' and |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refer to events that cause horror. But, while |hנְבָלָה|h* refers to horrific criminal acts, |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refers to horrific acts of desolation, often as punishment for criminal acts. While |hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime' refers to the kinds of events that call for swift judgment, |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refers to the acts of judgment themselves that are called for by serious crimes. The causative relationships may be shown like this:|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’ > horror > judgement > |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ > more horror2. Contrasting Focus of Synonyms|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’ perspectivises the extreme reaction of outrage to the sinful event.

\syntagcc The fixed expression ‘to commit a scandalous crime in Israel’ emphasises two things about such crimes: (1) they offend the public conscience of the nation as a whole, causing a nation-wide outcry and (2) the whole nation is implicated in the crime and must be purged by getting rid of the perpetrators from among them (cf. Deu 22:21; Jos 7; Jdg 19-20).

After all, by prostituting herself while under her father's authority, her |boffence has caused a scandal|b* among the people of Israel!
\eval Translators should find a strongly-worded expression that emphasises both the enormity of the offence (to God and to the entire community) and the serious consequences it brings (to the doer and to the community as a whole). CEV renders the fixed expression as ‘brought evil into your community’. This conveys part of the significance of the fixed expression. But since this aspect is already represented elsewhere in the verse, it is better at this point to emphasise the extreme offensiveness of the crime - one that should cause an outrage throughout all Israel. Unlike other modern translations, however, the CEV unambiguously shows that the fixed expression properly refers to the people of Israel, not to the land of Israel.REB renders the fixed expression as ‘committed an outrage in Israel’ (cf. ESV). This accurately portrays the idea of scandal, as does a noun like ‘infamy’ (NJB and TOB). GW’s ‘godless act’ may not always evoke the idea of public scandal for all English speakers, but it is better than the following. Several other translations are only a little astray by employing adjectives such as ‘disgraceful’ (NIV, NRSV, NLT, NCV, EIN) or ‘shameful’ (TEV, NJPS). Those that use ‘folly’ (LXX, RSV, NASB) are far from signifying the horrific enormity of the offence.The tentative KTBH rendering offered here redistributes semantic features. Where it says literally 'she did נְבָלָה among Israel', the notion of offence is made more explicit in: 'her offence caused a scandal among the people of Israel.'

Exceptions include ‘impiety’ (REB, NJPS), ‘evil’ (TEV) and ‘lies’ (NLT and NCV). But the guilt of the Israelites in Isaiah’s time was far greater than foolish lies would cause. Their scandalous words were no mere slips of the tongue or insignificant blunders, made because they were ignorant and foolish. Such meanings might be signalled when English words like ‘folly’ are used.

\eval The set of ideas prompted by the use of this noun will often require an expansive translation. Some elements may be omitted by simply conveying that God is not going to punish them as harshly as they deserve, as some modern versions do. A word like ‘folly’ does not render this noun’s meaning forcefully enough, despite CEV, NRSV, NCV, NIV and NASB. It could be an idea to make the connection between the offence and the punishment more explicit so that the notion of |hנְבָלָה|h* is clearly dissociated from YHWH: 'And then I will accept his prayer not to punish you as severely|i as your sacrilegious talk about me deserves.'|i* But the NJPS translation is also acceptable, although it presupposes that YHWH is the Agent (which brings it under Meaning 1.).

\sub ערם
\intro The noun |hעָרְמָה|h* does not necessarily have a pejorative meaning. In several cases, notably in Proverbs, it can better be translated as 'astuteness' or 'shrewdness' than as 'cunning', which has stronger negative associations.
\hebraist See See Fox, M.V. 1993 "Words for Wisdom." |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*6: 149-169.
\dfnotes As TWAT VI,388 notes, both |hעָרְמָה|h* and |hמְזִמָּה|h* hold the border line with the pejoratives (cunning, craftiness). This is related to the fact that in ancient Israel, wisdom education concentrated on intellectual attitudes rather than on morality. W. McKane rightly stresses in his |iProverbs|i* commentary (London 1970, 265): 'Wisdom did not educate men to change the world, but to make their way successfully in the world as it was.' Or in Fox's words: 'This [i.e. that Wisdom boasts proximity to |hעָרְמָה|h*, Pro 8:12] does not make |hעָרְמָה|h* an inherently virtuous ability; rather it is a practical faculty that wisdom promises its adherents.'

\keyverse REB89 - I am wisdom, I bestow |bshrewdness|b* and show the way to knowledge and discretion.
\eval 'Prudence' (NRS) is a colourless rendering. 'Shrewdness' is more fitting, because it approaches the border line with the pejorative connotation. But the choice also depends on how you render the other synonyms of wisdom found in this context (and in Pro 1:1-5).

\intro The term |hפֶּתִי|h* refers to a person who runs certain risks due to lack of intelligence and experience. Such a person believes everything and is easily seduced. He is not wise but is not beyond the possibility of improvement. A simpleton can and must be taught in order to become intelligent and gain experience.

\keyverse NIV84 - For the waywardness of the |bsimple|b* will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
\eval In general, most English versions translate |hפֶּתִי|h* with 'simple(ton)', 'ignorant', and even 'naive', while 'inexperienced' ('unerfahren') can be found in the Gute Nachricht. These do not seem unacceptable renderings on the whole. 'Stupid fools', on the other hand (CEV in Pro 19:25), is far too strong and misses the point. It is interesting that 'gullible' (Fox' proposal) is not found in English versions.

\eval Interestingly, English versions offer a variety of renderings here. 'Being simple' and 'simplicity' (REB, NJPS) are not bad renderings, but they are less adequate than 'being simpleminded' (NLT) because they have positive connotations. 'Naiveté' would be a good option.
