\intro From the verb הקק, which means to inscribe on a hard surface, or to decree, it refers to an authoritarian decree, or law, most often with the sense of permanence:1. a permanent and binding law, an enduring custom, prescribed by God or by a person in authority.3. a fixed and permanent allotment, or provision for designated individuals decreed by God or by a person in authority.4. a person's lot in life as decreed by God, whether it is fate or the fulfilment of a promise.5. the natural order and boundaries of the universe as set by GodThe most frequent context of this word is the Mosaic Law, especially in reference to laws and special allotments for the priests.The sense of permanence is re-inforced in a number of instances by the qualifying word 'OLAM (lasting) as in ----, and also in reference to natural boundaries and laws set by God.  When referring to legislation, the term חֹק is used to highlight the permanence of the laws. In the case of prescribed duties for servants (Sense 1, context h), however, the sense of permanence seems to be less prevalent; here חֹק seems to focus more on the sense of a fixed set of tasks for the day.
\altint A couple of passages have been glossed by HALOT as 'a prescribed task' : Exo 5:14, Pro 31:15. Both of these are interpreted here as |ia prescribed portion. |i*Aside from these two references, there is no other evidence that that XOQ should have this meaning. In both cases, the sense of '|ia prescribed amount to be alloted to an individual|i*' can be interpreted. |i |i*In the Exodus passage, the provision of the required allotment of bricks does indeed involve a required task. However, the Proverbs passage can be interpreted as a portion of food to be given to the female servants for their needs, rather than the notion of daily tasks assigned to them.
\comp 31x in the Psalms of which 22 in Psalm 119; 21x in DeuteronomyAll of the senses of חֹק involve 1) the domain of authoritarian action or decree, and 2) the sense of permanence or regularity. In Meaning 1, the recipient of the חֹק is required to perform certain actions. In Meaning 2, the beneficiary of the חֹק is the one who receives an allotment that is designated for him specifically. The third and fourth senses consist of an authoritarian action on the part of God that concern the lot of humans (Meaning 3), and the limits and laws of nature (Meaning 4).The paired expression: XOQ VE MISHPAT merits some attention, as it is variously translated. It can also be found in plural form. There seems to be a question as to whether it should be translated as a semantic unit ('fixed rule' NJPS), or as two separate items ('decrees and laws' NIV)
\dfnotes 1. The feminine form of XOQ, XUQQAH semantically overlaps with XOQ; however there is a different distribution of usage. a. XOQ is found more in reference to non-specified laws, while XUQQAH seems to be preferred in the context of specific laws. However, both terms can be found in both contexts. b. XOQ refers to the permanence of laws, while XUQQAH seems to focus more on the feature of repetition of laws and customs.  Thus, XUQQAH is used more frequently to refer to customs and traditions of other peoples.c. In the context of natural laws, XOQ refers more to the limits and order of nature, while XUQQAH refers to the repetitious acts of nature. 2. See MISHPAT, ''EDUT, MITSWAH, TORAH - note that these terms do not distinguish different types of laws. Rather they different aspects of the law - Mishpat - a judgment,  mitswah - a command, torah - direction, xoq - permanently established. Each one has a semantic field that overlaps with the other.

\syntagcc Rarely is the term associated with a specific law. It refers rather to the permanent establishment of a requirement. This is clearly illustrated in Exodus 12:24 (see below). Frequently it is found in a list or in parallel construction with other legal terms. Within lists, there are certain patterns of pairing.      a. frequent pairing with מִשְׁפָּט especially in Deuteronomy and Ezekiel; In Exo 15:25, this pairing is translated by NJPS as |ia fixed rule|i*, where |ifixed|i* expresses the sense of חֹק, and |irule|i* the sense of מִשְׁפָּט.      b. This pairing is, in several passages, associated in a part-whole relationship with תֹרָה, i.e. חֹק and מִשְׁפָּט are considered to be the primary ingredients of the תֹרָה, the body of laws given by God through Moses.     c. In Psalms 119, the verb למד (learn, teach) is more frequently associated with חֹק than with the other legal terms found in the Psalm.     See the collocational references below for more patterns. I

\eval NLT correctly brings out the sense of permanence in this verse. The NRS  '|iperpetual ordinance|i*' is also correct, but the sense is a little more difficult to grasp by the average reader.  The term '|ilaw|i*' may be more appropriate, as it embodies more completely the notion of a permanent regulation: '|iThese instructions are to become a law which you and your descendants are to observe for all time'|i*.

In three passages, the verb שׂים (establish) is associated with the noun.

\heb צלח
\pos v
\gloss be successful
\freq 63
\intro Since understanding of how ‘success’ comes about is culturally conditioned, the translation of צלח (‘be successful’) is likely to differ from language to language. In some it may be best expressed by the condition for success - ‘ability’ in some way; in others it may be best expressed by the outcome, such as an expression which covers ‘victory’. Since in scripture success (or lack of success) is divinely influenced, and also influenced by moral choices, the words chosen to translate ‘success’ should be able to carry these notions, rather than, for instance, to imply the possession of magical power.The frame of ‘success’ with respect to people requires: (i) a person who experiences or achieves the success; (ii) one of more events in which this person is successful (iii); a measure or way of distinguishing success from failure. While the first of these elements is always expressed in the Hebrew text, the other two may be unexpressed, to be inferred from the context. The extent to which this is acceptable in the language into which translation is being made will have to be determined; one or both of these elements may need to be made more explicit.It is likely that the concept of ‘success’ will need to be translated differently in one or more of the several domains that occur in scripture: Personal Welfare, Warfare (where ‘victory’ may be an appropriate translation), Land/Nation, Venture, God’s Purposes, Justice, Objects (see below). There is some overlapping of these domains.In the domain of ‘objects’ (which extends ‘success’ beyond the frame used by English speakers), a different word may need to be used to translate ‘success’ than is used for the other domains. This composite domain of ‘objects’ collects together three instances: ‘belt’, ‘vine’ and ‘wood of vine’ (in the NIV and NLT, for instance, ‘thrive’ is used in the context of ‘vine’.)The grammatical subject of the Hebrew verb expressing ‘success’ may be the person or people seeking success, the activity in which success takes place or is being sought (e.g. Num 14:41), or an object used by the person or people seeking success (e.g. Isa 54:17).In scripture, the frame of ‘success’ is found in a positive sub-frame (obeying God results in success, e.g. Jos 1:8), a negative sub-frame (disobeying God results in failure, e.g. Deu 28:29), and in what could be called a contrary sub-frame (evil men sometimes are successful, e.g. Psa 37:7), which gains its force of meaning from the normality of the other two sub-frames.
\hebraist The verb צלח may occur either in the qal form or the hiphil form. The hiphil form may or may not have a causative meaning. Whether the hiphil form takes on causative meaning or not is determined by the context.One issue that can be discussed is whether there is a distinction between the qal and the hiphil forms of this verb. Of the 55 usages of this Hebrew verb which refer to ‘success’ in the canonical Old Testament, the qal form is used 15 times and the hiphil form 40 times. Of these 40 uses, in some 30 of these instances the hiphil form is clearly used without causative meaning, that is to say only one agent is expressed; there are only about 10 instances of its use with clear causative meaning, that is to say two agents being expressed, one causing the other to be successful. All instances where the expressed grammatical subject is a thing, that is non-human, involve use of the qal form.One might surmise from this that the qal form is used where the subject is seen as less agentive. In other words that the hiphil form, even when only one agent is involved, is more agentive in some way (that is to say, the agent is seen more as causing himself to be successful.) We have labelled this role as agent/patient since the participant is always involved both in causing his success in some way and in experiencing it. However it does not seem possible to prove whether this distinction of agency (qal = less agentive, hiphil = more agentive, even when not causative) is correct. Western versions do not attempt to make such a distinction in their translations. In languages where degree of agency is marked, such a distinction might appear in translation. However, since the distinction cannot be proven, it is probably best in such languages to read agency out of the context rather than depend on a qal/hiphil distinction which cannot be substantiated.In two cases - Jdg 18:5 and Psa 1:3 - the hiphil form could potentially be analysed as causative (with God as causing agent), or with the activity (‘our road’, ‘all that he does’) as the grammatical subject. A causative analysis does not seem plausible in either case. In the first case the verb is clearly marked as having a feminine subject. In both cases (as additional evidence) the Septuagint translators understood the activity to be the subject.
\altint With respect to the plural verb ‘success’ in Jer 5:28, one question concerns who should be taken as the grammatical subject, whether the ‘wicked men’ of verse 26 or the ‘fatherless’ of this verse. Most modern translations render the clause as a purpose clause (c.f. Waltke and O’Connor 1990:650.) If the subject is taken as ‘wicked men’ it could be rendered (RSV) ‘they [wicked men] judge not with justice the cause of the fatherless, to make it prosper’, or (NIV) ‘they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it’. If the subject is taken as the ‘fatherless’ it could be rendered: ‘that they [the fatherless] may have success’.Tawil (Tawil 1976) argues from a related language that the verb in this context should be understood as ‘provide/render justice’ and, claiming implicit negation from the context, translates the verse (with ‘wicked men’ as subject): ‘they judge not the cause, the cause of the orphan they do not justly render’.Although these three interpretations differ in detail, they are concordant as regards the resultant meaning. Tawil’s interpretation is more radical, since it involves the detail of an extended meaning for צלח (‘provide/render justice’) and the need to adopt an implied negative; the resultant meaning in the context of the preceding and following clause is, nevertheless, the same.A fourth more literal possibility is represented by the Segond Révisé translation, but is more disjointed: ‘ils ne défendent pas la cause, la cause de l'orphelin, et ils prospèrent; ils ne font pas droit aux pauvres’/’they do not defend the cause, the cause of the orphan, and they prosper; they do not defend the right of the poor’. This disjointedness suggests that an original speaker/hearer would have understood the expression in a more meaningful way, however we lack sufficient access to original speaker/hearer knowledge to know what that would have been.If a grammatical subject or object has to be supplied, a compromise is to use ‘cause/case’ as the subject or object and render the clause as a purpose clause, as in the first two options presented above.
\dfnotes The domains of success that appear in scripture overlap to some extent. The personal success or welfare of the king, for instance, will affect the welfare of the land or nation.The frame of ‘success’ requires: (i) a person (or, in the Hebrew frame, a thing) who achieves and experiences the success; (ii) one of more events in which this person is successful (iii); a measure or way of distinguishing success from failure. (This last could also be thought of as the ideal version of (ii), that is to say a successful version of the event or events.) The first of these elements will be expressed in the Hebrew text, but the other two may be unexpressed, to be inferred from the context. The extent to which this is acceptable in the language into which translation is being done will have to be determined; one or both of these elements may need to be made more explicit. There may also be other participants, specifically agents; such as a ‘causing agent’ who causes the events to be successful (always Divine); and in one case (Jer 2:37) a ‘secondary’ or ‘helping agent’.In scripture, the frame of ‘success’ is found in a positive form (obeying God results in success, e.g. Jos 1:8), a negative form (disobeying God results in failure, e.g. Deu 28:29), and in what could be called a contrary form (evil men are sometimes successful, e.g. Psa 37:7), which gains its force of its meaning from the normality of the other two forms.The inclusion of objects in the frame of ‘successfulness’ for the Hebrew language means that this frame is conceptually larger than the corresponding frame in English. It includes notions of ‘effectiveness’ and ‘productiveness’ (and these could be considered supplementary names for this frame.)

\sub ענה
\intro עת appears to have a single basic meaning of a short period of (or point in) time (or, for a more distant time, perhaps a longer period of time). By virtue of this very bland meaning עת is normally found in association with a word or phrase denoting an event or situation (if a word, in the analysis below we have referred to it as the 'specifying term'). עת can also be found with indexicals ('this', 'that') and is used to relate one event to another in a discourse.An important question is whether the ANE notion of time was similar to our own, that is to say whether it was a 'scientific' notion of time, in which a uniform notion of linear time is a primary and independent concept. Of course, we also have our own 'folk' notion of time. More likely: (1) events or situations were seen as more primary; (2) many events recurred; (3) events were considered to be controlled or brought about in some way (including recurrent ones) - the 'world-of-the-Gods' was involved in controlling them, possibly in reaction of the actions of man. (4) As a consequence, we can probably claim ANE time was not an primary independent uniform abstract concept, but, in a more subsidiary fashion, part of the way of referring to events and situations, for instance the termination of a bad (for example, oppressive) situation, or the arrival in the future of a good (for example, righteous and lasting) situation. Evidence for this is that עת, as noted above, rarely occurs by itself. Where עת does occur by itself, it is often elliptical.
\comp there are grammatical differences in the use of 'time': (1) sentence (paragraph) initial - though this is also adverbial, it serves to help 'structure' the discourse; (2) as a conjunction which may be translated by 'when' - though also adverbial in form; (3) in a nominal phrase; (4) in other adverbial phrases - these may also serve to relate events (these differences should be noted in the analysis that follows, so that they are not ignored or confused)

\eval Most (RSV, NRS, REB, NJB, NJPS) accept one or other of the alternative emendations|nb|n*, though all appear to read יאנף and render it something like 'lest he be angry' (NIV, RSV, NJB). NIV (also ESV, NAS) capitalises 'Son' indicating a Messianic interpretation. TEV and CEV appear to accept the same interpretation as KTBH, as does NLT is also a good model translation, 'Submit to God's royal son, or he will become angry'. This makes explicit the king's role as God's adopted son.

The psalm is taken to be a coronation hymn, in which David or the Davidic king is presented as being adopted by Yahweh (v. 7). The surrounding nations are envisaged as being in the rebellion against the king and refusing to kiss him, that is to pay homage to him.Alternative suggestions are based on change of vowels, change of consonants or redivision of vv. 11-12. For a discussion see Bratcher and Reyburn, who reject the interpretation given here (HBK), and Craigie (WBC 1983) who defends it, noting that 'the use of בר here avoids the dissonance of בן פן'.A further question is whether the son in view is the Messiah, and thus whether 'Son' should be capitalised. In the original context of the psalm, the referent was probably the then King of Israel or Judah, and the psalm was not overtly prophetic, so the Experiencer was human and 'son' should probably not be capitalised.

\intro 1. There are two Hebrew words with the same form. One of them is a noun meaning either ‘anger’ or ‘nose, nostril, face’. The other is a particle meaning ‘also, even, indeed’.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist There is unanimous agreement that the particle אַף and the noun are homonyms (BDB, HALOT, DCH, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT). Equally there is agreement that the two meanings of the noun, 'nose, nostril' and 'anger', are related. The original meaning of the root אנף and the precise nature of the relationship between the meanings of אַף, however, are less certain.In some cases, the connection becomes explicit where other Hebrew words for 'anger' collocate with אַף used in the sense 'nose'. TDOT cites Ezk 38:18 and Psa 18:8-9, noting that 'in the OT the nose plays a certain role in the description of anger' (1.351). Similarly in Isa 65:5, 'these people are smoke in my nose' implying that they are a source of irritation and anger.One suggestion is that אנף may originally have meant 'to snort' and thus form a link between 'nose' and 'anger' but this is not universally accepted (TDOT 1.351).
\comp 1 Focus: response; response: anger	a Experiencer: God	b Experiencer: human2 Other meanings	a nose, nostril or face	b also, even, indeed
\dfnotes For notes see other synonyms. In addition:It may be helpful to distinguish positive and negative frames for divine anger:For the positive frame, the domain related to the stimulus event is apostasy, and that related to the consequence frame is judgement.For the negative frame 'turning from anger' the domain related to the stimulus event is repentance, and that related to the consequence frame is mercy.The negative frame is often expressed by a construction with |hשׁוב|h*, either with the verb in the Qal and |hאַף|h* as subject, often with a |hמִן|h* phrase of the former target, (x18), or with the verb in the Hiphil and God as subject (x5).Alternatively, it may be expressed by the Hiphil of |hנוח|h* with |hחֵמָה|h* as object, 'God gave rest to his anger'.

\keyverse KTBH - Then he speaks to them in his |banger|b*, and in his fury he terrifies them
\eval Most translations use two of the available English synonyms for the two Hebrew synonyms in the parallelism - 'anger, wrath' (NIV), 'anger, fury' (TEV), 'anger, rage' (NJB, NJPS) or 'wrath, fury' (RSV, NRS). These are all good models, though, perhaps, since |hאַף|h* is the most common of the Hebrew synonyms, and 'anger' is the most common in English, 'anger' might be the best choice. REB renders the prepositional phrase 'in his anger' by the adverb 'angrily' which may also be followed. CEV renders the verse rather freely, 'The Lord becomes furious and threatens them'.

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning for the verb is between ‘to curse’ or ‘to be angry’. Note that the noun from the same root refers only to anger.2. For the Meaning 'to curse', there is a further distinction in meaning between God cursing someone, Meaning 1a, and someone cursing someone else, Meaning 1b.3. For the Meaning 'to be angry', there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry at someone, Meaning 2a, and someone being angry at someone else, Meaning 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist The relationship between this noun and its cognate verb requires specific comment. The noun collocates frequently with words for 'anger', whereas the verb does not. In Num 23:7-8 and Pro 24:24, the verb collocates instead with words meaning 'to curse'. The relationship then may be that, for the verb, the meaning shifts from 'to be angry' > 'to speak in anger' > 'to curse', whereas for the noun, the meaning 'anger' dominates.

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone being physically unwell or emotionally upset and showing it, Meaning 3.2. The one instance of Meaning 2 refers to the violence of the sea, behaving as if it were angry (cf Meaning 1).
\hebraist Most of the instances of |hזעף|h* and its cognates occur in contexts where the meaning 'anger' is appropriate. A few, particularly Gen 40:6 and Dan 1:10, cannot have that meaning, leading some to propose two homonyms. |hזעף|h* I 'to rage, be angry' is well attested in cognate languages, but the existence of |hזעף|h* II is debated. HALOT, TDOT and NIDOTTE all defend homonym II by citing an Arabic root|i ḍaʿif|i* 'look wretched, pitiful, dejected' though TDOT notes that |iḍ |i*does not correspond to Hebrew |hז|h*.BDB maintains a single root with a central meaning 'be out of humour' which develops in two directions 'be dejected' and 'be enraged' corresponding to the two main meanings presented here.

\eval Most translations render |hזעף|h* with '[his heart] rages' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB, NJB, NJPS). This is a good model to follow. TEV and CEV use 'blame', thereby making explicit the implicit step in the experience which might go 'experience ruin' > 'blame someone' > 'get angry with that someone'. This shift may be necessary if the 'blame' step is not obvious.

\eval Some translations follow the structure of the Hebrew closely: 'and the sea ceased from its raging' (RSV, NRS), 'and the sea stopped raging' (NJB, NJPS). Others recognise that the raging is a property of the sea and translate 'the raging sea' (NIV), the raging of the sea' (REB). 'Rage' is a good rendering because the English and Hebrew match, though this may not be possible in other languages. TEV conveys the meaning without the word 'rage': '[the sea] calmed down' (CEV similar). Depending on translation style, any of these would be a good model to follow.

\syntagc The term זעף expresses a response to an incomprehensible dream in one case, and a change of diet in the other. In neither case is anger appropriate to the context. The fact that Joseph saw that something was wrong suggests that the word refers to something visible. Joseph's reference to the men's faces being רָעִים 'sad' also supports the element 'and to show it' in the definition. In a similar way, Nebuchadnezzar would have observed a problem.

All fit the context well and all are consistent with the evidence for meaning. It would probably be best, however, to choose a translation equivalent which indicates that whatever was wrong was visible.

\intro Both instances of the word refer to someone being angry with someone else.
\altint The majority view (HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE) is that the adjective is derived from |hזעף|h* I and has the sense 'angry'. It is worth noting, however, that |hזעף|h* II, with the sense 'out of humour, dejected' would also fit. In particular, the clause 'and he turned his face [away]' later in 1Ki 21:4 is consistent with dejection.

\sub יחם
\intro 1. Most instances of the word refer to anger or to the heat of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word means ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. In a few instances, the word has other meanings, perhaps related to heat. One is ‘poison, venom’, Meaning 2a, and another is heat from wine, Meaning 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist חֵמָה is generally agreed to be derived from יחם, though חמם and יחם are closely associated roots and there is even some doubt over which of the two roots gives rise to some of the Qal forms.חמם means 'to be hot' in various senses, and יחם also means 'to be' hot', but in a more limited sexual and reproductive sense. This sexual and reproductive sense, however, is not attested for חֵמָה. Its most common sense is 'anger', though it occurs a few times in the senses 'poison, venom' and 'heat from wine'. As TDOT notes, 'the notion of "being hot" ... probably furnishes the point of departure for all three meanings'.

\keyverse NIV - O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your |bwrath|b*
\eval A problem here is the two words for 'anger' in the parallel cola. Most use two English synonyms: 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB), 'anger, fury' (NJPS) or 'anger, heat of wrath' (NJB). Use of the neutral 'anger' for the common אַף is natural, but care is necessary for the other word to avoid wrong connotations. 'Wrath' is little-used except for God's wrath, but may be the best choice. 'Fury' conveys intensity and is appropriate for a temporary anger, which is not a settled attitude. CEV collapses the parallel cola  without loss of meaning and thus needs only one word 'anger'. This may also be followed.

\gloss to burn [with anger]
\freq 93
\intro 1. Most instances of the word refer to burning with anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word means ‘anger’, There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.3. In a few instances, the word has other meanings. One is ‘to be worried or distressed’, Meaning 2a, another is ‘to compete’, Meaning 2b, and a third is ‘zealously’, Meaning 2c.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist Other ANE languages have a cognate root which has the meaning 'to burn' in a literal sense. This suggests that the literal meaning may also have been present in Hebrew, but in the Hebrew Bible the root only occurs in metaphorical senses, particularly 'to burn with anger'. It does however, collocate with literal fire, both in narrative (Num 11:1) and in poetry (2Sa 22:8-9, Psa 18:8-9).Other verbs עבר 'to burn' (Psa 2:12, Isa 30.27) and עשׁן 'to smoke' (Deu 29:19, Psa 74:1) also take אַף (and other words for anger) as subject, though less often than חרה and their literal meaning is more prominent.  חרה is unique, however, in that the literal sense is unattested.Of the two main constructions of the Qal,|na|n* one makes the anger explicit, 'someone's anger burned', and the other is an impersonal construction in which the anger is implicit, 'it burned to someone' = 'someone was angry'. The latter construction is also attested in Hebrew for other emotions.|nb|n* There appears, however, to be little or no difference between the two constructions. The fuller expression is used for most instances of Yahweh's anger, but not consistently. The shorter expression is more common for human anger, but both occur.
\evalev HALOT proposes a second homonym, attested only at Isa 24:6. The Westminster Hebrew Institute, in their morphological database, however, follow the majority of authorities (BDB, NIDOTTE, GKC, Even-Shoshan) against HALOT and considers the form חָרוּ, found at Isa 24:6, to be derived from the root חרר 'to burn'.

\dfnotes See other synonyms for notes. In addition:1. 'Then David was angry because the Lord's wrath had broken out against Uzzah' (2Sa 6:8, NIV, similarly REB) is an informative mistranslation. The Hebrew makes Yahweh the subject of the verb |hפרץ|h*, but NIV makes Yahweh's anger into the subject, thereby demoting Yahweh in terms of the actor-undergoer hierarchy, and presenting him as being driven by his own anger. Others follow Hebrew more closely, making Yahweh the agent of the 'breaking out'.2. It is the event-type of the associated events that determines the domains involved. For example, for divine anger, the stimulus is typically apostasy and the consequence is judgement.

\gram There are two main constructions (see further the Comments for Hebraists), one of which makes the anger explicit, 'someone's anger burned', and the other is an impersonal construction in which the anger is implicit, 'it burned to someone' = 'someone was angry'. Whichever occurs in the Hebrew, the same translation options may be used (see Evaluation or Translations).

\intro 1. All but one instance of the word refers to the burning of anger, Meaning 1.2. When the word refers to ‘anger’, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b. 3. In Psa 58:10, the meaning is very uncertain, Meaning 2.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist For discussion of the likely original sense 'burning' of the root see the cognate verb |hחרה|h*. Although the term is never used of literal burning,|na|n* it is used in contexts in which literal burning is a consequence of God's anger (eg Lam 4:11).In a similar manner to the verb, there are two constructions, the more common in which |hאַף|h* 'anger' is explicit, God's |hחֲרֹון אַף|h*, and the less common in which it is implicit, God's |hחָרֹון|h*. There appears to be little or no difference in meaning between the two constructions.

This works well in English and could be followed in other languages where it is natural. NIV mutes the imagery, but is otherwise similar, 'fierce anger'. It may be appropriate to use an intensifying adjective with a basic word for 'anger' in this way. Others simplify the expression to 'indignation' (TEV) or 'be furious' (CEV).

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone experiencing anger, frustration etc, Meaning 1, and someone causing someone to else experience the anger etc, Meaning 2.2. Another distinction which requires care in translation is the nature of the response. The verb has a wider range of meaning than some other anger terms. It is used for responses which include frustration, Meaning 1c, and fear, Meaning 2c, as well as anger, Meanings 1a and 1b. Sometimes it may be wise to translate with a neutral word like the English ‘to provoke’.3. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The two instances of the Piel both collocate closely with the Hiphil. Either they describe the same sequence of events (1Sa 1:6-7) or they connect two similar events (a cause and its effect; Deu 32:21). Both stems signal a causative meaning. The distinction is stylistic, not semantic (TDOT: 'the very rare piel appears to represent a stylistically motivated variant to a nearby hiphil').2. The cognate noun (see כַּעַס) collocates with the verb, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction eg בְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה ‘because of the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).3. The majority of instances of this root are spelled with ס, but in the book of Job, it is spelled consistently with שׂ. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. TDOT and NIDOTTE suggest that the spelling with שׂ may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate.

\dfnotes With a few exceptions the meanings of כעס all relate to the same frame, labelled simply ‘anger’ in which the elements are: 	the anger event itself	an experiencer of the anger	an event which is the stimulus for the anger	an agent who instigates that event and may be described as the agent which causes the anger	a target of the anger who is normally the same as the agent	consequence event(s) of the anger having an impact on the targetMeaning 1 points to the anger event itself, while for Meaning 2 the focus is the event which is the stimulus for the anger.Subsequent research might show that it would be better to deal with two sub-frames, divine anger and human anger, which would relate to different domains in different ways. Alternatively, since, at least some of the time, the anger of a man of God is expected to match that of God, the sub-frames might be righteous and unrighteous anger.Perhaps because anger is such a common human experience, the anger frame is evoked in many contexts so that the frame is understood against a background of many domains. Thus there are no core domains, only non-core. For example:	Wickedness: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Idolatry: God's anger is provoked by idolatry	Injustice: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the sin of the agent	Unbelief: God's anger towards the target/agent is a response to the unbelief of Israel in the wilderness	Prophecy: a prophet provoked the anger of an ungodly king	Judgement: God's anger against the target was expected to have punishment as a consequence

\eval It is important to distinguish the response from anger. Most translations appropriately use a generic translation, eg 'I will trouble' (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV) or 'I shall cause disquiet' (REB). CEV's 'nations will be shocked' may capture more precisely the nature of the response which God provokes, as indicated in v. 10. However, its use of a passive, perhaps for stylistic reasons, reduces the force of nineteen first person singular verbs in twelve verses in the Hebrew, which emphasise what Yahweh will do. NJPS's use of ‘vex’ (its normal equivalent for |hכעס|h*) implies anger, which is out of place here. Similarly, 'grieve' (NJB) slightly misreads the response.

Although TDOT favours God as the implied Experiencer for each of five other instances listed below, it rejects this interpretation in the case of Nehemiah 3:37. Evidence for this view includes Sanballat's ridicule of the Jews (v. 33), which may point to the 'builders' as the Experiencers (Use 2b). Arguments against this position include:1. It would involve a unique use of this preposition and Williamson (WBC, 1985:214) sees this as 'an insuperable difficulty'. 2.

In five other instances God is the implied, but unexpressed, Experiencer of the Hiphil of |hכעס|h* (1Ki 21:22; 2Ki 21:6; 2Ki 23:19; Hos 12:15; Psa 106:29). 3. Nehemiah's request earlier in the same verse 'do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from before you' may imply some offence against God, which would provoke His anger.A third possibility (not followed in any translation) may be indicated by the context of the previous few verses (33-36), where it was Nehemiah and his associates who were being provoked (in the hearing of the builders).
\notxx (c) Probably.Following Williamson (WBC, 1985:214, 217) and some modern translations (eg NLT, ESV, RSV), KTBH assigns Nehemiah 3:37 to Use 2a and recommends making God the explicit Experiencer whose anger is being provoked. Fensham (NICOT), TDOT and other modern translations (eg NIV, NRS, NJPS, NJB, NAB and REB), however, interpret the preposition in |hלְנֶגֶד הַבּוֹנִים |h*'in front of the builders' as signalling the people provoked rather than the witnesses of the provocation. Although TDOT favours God as the implied Experiencer for each of five other instances listed below, it rejects this interpretation in the case of Nehemiah 3:37.

\not (d) In the relationship between Hannah and Peninnah, Hannah’s emotional response would have been complex and mixed, but is likely to have included both anger and grief. Even without Penninnah’s malicious provocation, Hannah would have been experiencing grief, shame and jealousy, simply because of her childlessness and the constant presence of a rival wife. That provocation must have introduced something new to the mixture of negative emotions. As a response to provocation, probably in the form of taunting as several versions suggest, it may best be described as anger.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between the anger, grief etc which someone experiences, Meaning 1, and what causes someone to experience the anger etc, Meaning 2.2. Another distinction which requires care in translation is the nature of the response. The noun has a wider range of meaning than some other anger terms. It is used for responses which include grief, Meaning 1c, and frustration, Meaning 1d, as well as anger, Meanings 1a and 1b. Sometimes it may be wise to translate with a neutral word like the English ‘provocation’.3. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*) collocates with the noun, either in a simple cognate accusative construction (1Sa 1:6) or in a more complex relative construction e.g.|hבְּכַעְסוֹ אֲשֶׁר הִכְעִיס אֶת־יְהוָה|h* ‘with the provocation with which he provoked Yahweh’ (1Ki 15:30 cf. 1Ki 21:22, 2Ki 23:26).2. The majority of instances of the root are spelled with a |hס|h*, but in the book of Job, the spelling is consistently with |hשׂ|h*. There appears to be no difference in meaning, so KTBH treats the two forms in the same entry as alternative spellings. It is suggested that the spelling with |hשׂ|h* may indicate a relationship to an Arabic cognate (TDOT, NIDOTTE) or that it is a dialectal variation (BDB, TWOT).3. Unlike the cognate verb (see |hכעס|h*), the participants are, for the most part, not closely linked syntactically to the head word. Some are vague, especially in the Wisdom literature (see below), but generally they can be recovered from the wider context and a knowledge of the frame involved.
\comp 1 Focus: response	a Experiencer: God; response: anger; target: human	b Experiencer: human; response: anger; target: human	c Experiencer: human; response: grief; target: none	d Experiencer: human; response: frustration; target: futility2 Focus: provocation	a Experiencer: God; response: anger	b Experiencer: human; response: anger
\dfnotes For notes on the ‘anger’ frame, see this section in the entry for the cognate verb.The Contextual Uses of Meaning 1 are closely related since anger, grief and frustration are closely related experiences. The Specific Frame listed is, in each case, a sub-frame of the more generic 'stimulus - negative response' frame. The main points of distinction between the sub-frames concern the nature of the emotions and the reactions they cause, but they may also be distinguished on the basis of differences in participant roles.The ‘grief’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by the absence of a target. Otherwise, the corresponding elements are present:	the grief event itself	an experiencer of the grief	an event which is the stimulus for the grief	an agent who may instigate that event	a consequence event - weeping etcThe ‘frustration’ frame is distinguished from the ‘anger’ frame by an impersonal instrument causing the frustration and absence of an agent 	the frustration event itself	an experiencer of the frustration	an event which is the target for the frustration - in Ecclesiastes it is the futility of life and toil. In the causing event, this is an abstract instrument rather than a personal agent.
\addinfo The Wisdom writings sometimes leave participants unexpressed and very general (eg the target in Ecc 7:9 and the experiencer in Pro 27:3). It is the knowledge of the 'anger' frame that enables the reader to recognise that there must be an experiencer and a target in each case.

\keyverse KTBH - My eye has wasted away from |bgrief|b*; it has grown weak because of all my foes
\eval Most translate by 'grief' (RSV, NRS, REB) or 'sorrow' (NIV, CEV). This seems appropriate because the effect on the psalmist's eyes is likely to be from weeping. The use of 'vexation' by NJPS and NJB points to anger rather than grief, so should be avoided. TEV ‘I can hardly see; my eyes are so swollen from the weeping caused by my enemies’ makes the weeping explicit and points unambiguously to grief, though it does not have a direct equivalent to |hכַּעַס|h*.

A subjective genitive ‘provocation by his sons' would be readily understood. Other translations transform the noun into a verb and thereby convey the same meaning eg 'because he was angered by his sons and daughters' (NIV). Several translations reconstruct the verse to achieve a smoother reading eg NRS, 'The LORD saw it, and was jealous; he spurned his sons and daughters.' It is not clear, however, whether this is a decision to follow the emendation proposed in BHS or whether it is a matter of translation technique.

\not (b) In the phrase כַּעַס אוֹיֵב ‘the provocation of an enemy’, the 'enemy' could be either a subjective or an objective genitive. A subjective genitive would imply that the enemy was the Experiencer. However, the enemy’s misunderstanding and false claim that it was they who had defeated Israel (v. 27b) would constitute provocation to Yahweh (cf Craigie, NICOT). In this respect, the construction is similar to several instances of the Hiphil of the cognate verb כעס where Yahweh is the unexpressed Experiencer.Thus KTBH takes the Experiencer to be Yahweh and the enemy to be the Agent and assigns this instance to Use 2a.

\not (e) English translations differ in their treatment of this instance of |hכַּעַס|h*. NIV, NRS and REB translate ‘grief’ (cf KTBH Use 1c); CEV and TEV are similar. RSV, NJPS, NJB and also WBC translate ‘vexation’ (cf KTBH Use 2b). The difference appears to be whether |hעָמָל וְכַעַס|h* are seen as cause and effect ‘trouble [which causes] grief’ or as synonyms ‘mischief and provocation [which together provoke anger]’.Since the Psalm focuses on the activity of the wicked, it seems better to take both |hעָמָל|h* and |hכַּעַס|h* as describing that activity, rather than the response of the victim. KTBH thus classifies this instance as Use 2b, ‘something which provokes anger’.

\gloss to pass over, to be angry
\freq 562
\sub מַעְבָּר, מַעְבָּרָה, עֲבוּר, עֵבֶר, עֶבְרָה, עֲבָרָה
\intro 1. This is a very common word, often meaning ‘to pass over, to pass by, to pass through‘ in a literal sense. Instances of this meaning are listed briefly without analysis as ‘Other meanings’, Meaning 4.2. Certain instances of the term, marked by the Hebrew verb form, have a different meaning and mostly refer to anger.3. When the meaning is anger, the key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meanings 1b, 2a. 3. Meaning 3 is distinguished in Pro 14:16, where the word refers to arrogance. Compare Meaning 2 of the cognate noun. Elsewhere it refers to anger.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist Most authorities recognise two homonyms for עבר (BDB, HALOT, TDOT, NIDOTTE, TWOT), but express some uncertainty about their relationship to one another and to the noun עֶבְרָה. BDB seems to imply an etymological link from עבר I (mostly Qal and Hiphil) 'to pass over' to עֶבְרָה '[overflowing of] anger, arrogance' to עבר II (Hithpael only) 'to be arrogant, furious'. HALOT proposes a link to an Arabic root meaning 'to be nasty' and TDOT appears to refer to the same Arabic root 'be malicious, malice, rancour, resentment'. Only the Hithpael, assumed to be from homonym II is treated here as a key term.

\eval Apart from TEV 'God was angry', most translations express some intensified form of anger. Thus, 'very angry' (NIV), 'full of wrath' (RSV, NRS), 'enraged' (REB, NJPS), 'furious' (CEV). These are all acceptable models, but it is hard to justify intensifying the anger, unless the Hithpael form is taken to imply, in itself, intensification.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between the majority of instances of this word which refer to anger, Meaning 1, and a small number which refer to arrogance, Meaning 2.2. When the meaning is anger, there is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.

\meaning The emotion of anger
\frame Anger
\gram The plural occurs three times (Job 21:30; 40:11; Psa 7:7) without obvious difference in meaning. It may be a plural of intensity (cf Jouon and Muraoka 136.f, GKC 124.e) or, at least at Job 40:11 and Psa 7:7, it could indicate a repeated series of actions or a habitual behaviour 'outbursts of anger' (HALOT, cf IBHS 7.4.2.c, VDM 24.3.3.v).

\eval Most translations use 'anger, wrath' (NIV, RSV, NRS, REB, NJB), for the two Hebrew synonyms in the parallelism. This is a good model, since 'wrath' is acceptable when God is the experiencer. However, TEV and CEV choose a less old-fashioned alternative from among the range of available English synonyms, 'anger, fury' (TEV, CEV). NJPS uses 'ire, wrath', but 'ire' is probably too archaic to be used.

'Anger' is a good choice for אַף, but 'wrath' is probably archaic, unless God is the experiencer, so 'anger, fury' or 'anger, rage' are preferable.CEV collapses the bicolon to one clause and renders the two parallel Hebrew words by 'fierce anger'.

\intro 1. The key meaning distinction is between someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1, and someone making someone else angry, Meaning 2.2. There is a further distinction in meaning between God being angry with someone, Meanings 1a, 2a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist In this analysis, the Qal expresses a state ‘be angry’ or a process ‘become angry’ while the Hiphil expresses a causative ‘make angry’ in accord with the prototypical senses of the respective stems. Traditional Hebrew lexicography reached the same conclusion, distinguishing a stative Qal (BDB: ‘be wroth’ and HALOT: ‘be angry’) from a causative Hiphil (BDB: ‘provoke to wrath’ and HALOT: ‘to rouse to anger’), though their glosses may have relied too much on the morphology.

\eval Most translations use some variation on the word 'anger': 'was angry (NIV, REB, NJPS), 'became angry' (TEV), 'was angered' (RSV). Any of these is a good model to follow. NRS uses 'wrathful' which is acceptable for divine anger. CEV assumes a causal relationship between the first two clauses of the verse and combines them, 'You had made the Lord angry'. This loses too much of the Hebrew and should not be followed. NJB combines the second and third clauses, making the second into a prepositional phrase, 'in his anger swore ...'. This may be followed if it is more natural in the receptor language.

\not (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its meaning from that of the Qal.
\notfr (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its lexical meaning from that of the Qal. BDB may be overinfluenced by the morphology in giving an explicitly reflexive gloss ‘put oneself in a rage’ and Young goes even further, ‘The people will work themselves into a frenzy, exciting themselves to anger‘ (1965:321). If the prototypical reflexive nuance of the Hithpael is present, it may make the people responsible for their own state, ‘they work themselves into a state,’ but HALOT 'fallen into a rage' lacks a reflexive nuance.The Hithpael does, however, also differ slightly in its event frame from the Qal, in that it is a force, distress and hunger, which causes the anger and the target of the anger is the king and their god(s). This different event frame might imply a slightly different nuance. The prototypical link between what causes the anger and its target is broken, so both the anger and its experiencers are less rational. [Note for future research, to be confirmed or rejected: in the ancient Hebrew worldview, if there are no uncaused events, then anger at king and god may be the natural response to distress and hunger.]There is an additional problem here in establishing the Target. In the next clause the phrase  'the king and their god(s)' is governed by |hבְּ|h*. This is unusual with |hקלל|h*, which normally expresses the Target of the curse with an accusative, and the rare instances of |hבְּ|h* (1Sa 17:43) or |hבְּשֵׁם|h* (2Kg 2:24) point to the God or gods invoked to enforce the curse (cf BDB, HALOT). For this reason, most commentators understand the cursers to invoke their king and their gods (WBC, Young, TOTC, KD, but not NICOT). By contrast, most translations take 'the king and their God/gods' to be the Target of the curse and therefore also the anger (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV, NJB). To do otherwise would leave both cursing and anger without any Target, so KTBH recommends following the majority of translations.The final problem is whether or not the God/god(s) who is cursed is Yahweh. Translations and commentaries are divided on the issue, but the occult involvement in v. 19 suggests that ‘their god(s)’ is no longer Yahweh and the translation should not have an upper case G.

By contrast, most translations take 'the king and their God/gods' to be the Target of the curse and therefore also the anger (NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV, NJB).

\notpt (a) The Hithpael occurs only once (Isa 8:21) and there are insufficient grounds to distinguish its lexical meaning from that of the Qal. BDB may be overinfluenced by the morphology in giving an explicitly reflexive gloss ‘put oneself in a rage’ and Young goes even further, ‘The people will work themselves into a frenzy, exciting themselves to anger‘ (1965:321). If the prototypical reflexive nuance of the Hithpael is present, it may make the people responsible for their own state, ‘they work themselves into a state,’ but HALOT 'fallen into a rage' lacks a reflexive nuance.The Hithpael does, however, also differ slightly in its event frame from the Qal, in that it is a force, distress and hunger, which causes the anger and the target of the anger is the king and their god(s). This different event frame might imply a slightly different nuance. The prototypical link between what causes the anger and its target is broken, so both the anger and its experiencers are less rational. [Note for future research, to be confirmed or rejected: in the ancient Hebrew worldview, if there are no uncaused events, then anger at king and god may be the natural response to distress and hunger.]There is an additional problem here in establishing the Target. In the next clause the phrase  'the king and their god(s)' is governed by |hבְּ|h*.

\intro 1. The main distinction in meaning is between God being angry with someone, Meaning 1a, and someone being angry with someone else, Meaning 1b.2. In Hos 10:7, an etymologically unrelated word of the same form is used in the sense ‘something of little value or significance’, Meaning 2.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\hebraist 1. The general view is that Meaning 2 is taken from a homonymous root found in the HB only as nouns. The masculine form |hקֶצֶף|h* occurs only at Hos 10:7 (see below), and the feminine form |hקְצָפָה|h* only at Jol 1:7, where it has an abstract sense 'snapping, splintering' (BDB) or 'literally snapped, in particular of damage from breaking off twigs or branches' (HALOT).2. The noun in Meaning 1 is used with the verb twice in a cognate accusative construction (Zec 1:2, 15).

A second key meaning distinction is between someone or something trembling, for whatever reason, Meanings 1 and 2, and someone making someone or something else tremble, Meanings 3 and 4.4. There are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The nature of that emotion can be established from the context.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\comp Although there is only one instance of literal, physical shaking or trembling (1Sa 14:15), that seems to be the central meaning of the word-group (cf TDOT). Other senses seem to develop from that in various contexts. In the context of theophany, heaven and earth tremble. Elsewhere, human trembling results from intense emotion - fear, anger, grief or excitement. In some cases, there may be associated physical trembling but, in others, that disappears from view and the trembling is metaphorical, internal and emotional.1 Stem: Qal; agent: none; theme: subject	a Theme: inanimate; context: earthquake	b Theme: inanimate, but personified; context: theophany2 Stem: Hiphil; agent: subject; theme: object	a Agent: God; theme: inanimate, but personified; target: none; context: theophany3 Stem: Qal or Hithpael; agent: none; experiencer: subject	a Experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	b Experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	c Experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	d Experiencer: human; target: human or God; context: anger	e Experiencer: human; target: none; context: grief	f  Experiencer: human; target: none; context: excitement4 Stem: Hiphil or Qal; agent: subject; theme or experiencer: object	a Agent: God or human; experiencer: human; target: none; context: fear	b Agent: human; experiencer: God; target: human; context: anger	c Agent: human; experiencer: human; target: none; context: disturbance

\eval The context is clearly one of grief, but translations differ in whether they focus on the trembling, either physical or internal, or on the grief. Thus TEV makes the grief explicit 'was overcome with grief' but at the expense of any nuance of motion, whereas CEV 'started trembling' does not make clear that the trembling arises from emotion and, in English, trembling is not conventionally associated with grief. RSV, NRS and REB render 'was deeply moved'. This is a good model to follow, because it conveys the nuance of motion present in the Hebrew imagery, makes clear that the motion is internal and emotional and allows the contest to make clear that the emotion is grief. It is better than 'was shaken' (NIV, NJPS) which is less clearly arising from emotion.

NJPS conveys the intensity of the emotion, using 'anguished', while others specify it 'anxious' (NIV, similarly TEV), unquiet (REB). Since it is hard to be precise about the nature of the emotion, any of these may be followed.

The main meaning distinction is between literal, physical shaking or trembling, Meaning 1, and metaphorical or internal shaking as a result of a negative emotion, Meaning 2.3. There are further distinctions in meaning based on the context and on the cause of the trembling. In some cases there is an associated emotion. The nature of that emotion can be established from the context.
\tnotes God’s anger is always righteous. It is directed against a person or people who are wrong. It may be translated by the same terms as human anger, unless those terms can only mean sinful anger.
\altint This form of the root is particularly difficult to classify and the scheme below should be taken as tentative. If the root is accepted as meaning 'to tremble' then that sense can be detected in some cases, but is largely absent for others.

\gloss to uncover, reveal, depart, to carry away (into exile)
\freq 187
\sub גּוֹלָה, גָּלוּת, גִּלָּיוֹן
\intro This verb either means 'to go into exile' or 'to reveal'. As I have analysed it, this verb has seven main meanings - 1. To go into exile. 2. To carry or be carried into exile 3. To depart 4. To be carried away. 5. To wither and disppear. 6. To be removed.  7. To reveal, or uncover (as yet uncompiled).Meaning two implies an agent, whether explict or not. There are  many cases where the LORD is the agent ie the one causing the people to be deported and have to live in exile in a foreign country e.g. 2Ki 17:11, 1Ch 5:41; Jer 29:7, 14; (Lam 4:22;) Ezk 39:28 and Amo 5:27. See also 1Ch 5:26 where Yahweh stirs up the spirit of two Assyrian kings to take several tribes from Israel into exile, and Amo 1:6 where he promises to punish those (‘Gaza’ i.e. Philistines?) who sold captives from Israel to Edom.
\tnotes Note the two main senses: 'to go into exile' and 'to reveal' . Within the first main sense the various contextual uses of the verb can be broken up by use of frames. The most frequently occurring frame is 'exile' but others also occur.
\hebraist The two homonyms are mainly split by the roots of the verb (1. Niphal? Hiphil and Hophal respectively vs. 2. Piel, Pual, and Hithpolel respectively). The Qal, however, can mean either. Roughly half the Qal, and all the Hiphil, (Niphal?) and Hophal forms of this verb are used with the sense of 'to depart' (into exile).
\altint NIDOTTE suggests that the word has a core meaning of 'to uncover', but the evidence for this is unconvincing.
\addinfo Some general notes on the exile follow here. It means to go or be taken from your homeland into a foreign country by an invading power. This is often referred to by the term 'exile', but is really a mass deportation, as still happens occasionally in modern times (eg Stalin's deportation of some minority groups from Russia to Central Asia).|b |b*To understand the exile from a biblical perspective one must first read about God's covenant with his people Israel in the book of Deuteronomy. In that book they are promised many blessings if they obey God, and curses if they do not (Deu 11:26). If they obey God, they will remain in the land which they have yet to conquer, but has been promised to them. If they disobey God they will be removed from the land (Deu 28:63). The term גלה does not occur until the historical books, where it is reported that the Israelites did disobey God, and so they were sent into exile (2Ki 17:23). By this time the kingdom was split into two, the Northern kingdom was exiled to Assyria, and much later the Southern kingdom was exiled to Babylon. The actual dates are 734 and 722 BC for Israel, and 597 and 586 BC for Judah. Of course it did not end there, as some from Israel remained in the North and intermarried with other peoples (to form the Samaritans?), and some in the South remained in Judah at the time of their exile. But the books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell us how a group of believers came back to Jerusalem in Judah and began rebuilding the city walls and the temple. They found that those who had remained in the land had mostly intermarried with the surrounding peoples.

\sub מַלְאָכוּת
\intro 1. The noun |hמַלְאָךְ |h*refers to any person sent by a superior to deliver a message or carry out a task.2. It also refers to a person or non-human agent sent by God to deliver a message or carry out a task.3. In one case in Ps. 104:4 the wind and fire are called |hמַלְאָךְ |h*of God.4. The term can also be used in describing a person in a comparative way, as in "you are like an angel of God to me." In this case the point of similarity in the comparison varies according to context: examples include appearance, in that they looked bright/strong (like people think angels usually look like), or the angel-like person has done good for the person making the comparison, thus the person is similar in helping or giving blessings to people.
\hebraist The suggested root is l'k from Ug., Arabic and Ethiopic 'to send'. No verb forms of this root are found in BH. The only other word derived from this root is the hapax legomenon |hמַלְאָכוּת|h*, 'message' (cf. Hag. 1:13).

\syntagcc The most common phrase in the OT for the messenger sent by God is 'angel of the Lord'. Also, 'angel of God' or just 'angel' are used. The angel of the Lord can represent or stand in the place of God, and in some passages the text is not clear if God himself is speaking or if an angel is speaking for him. Therefore the angel has all the authority that God has, when speaking to people. Whenever people saw an angel they were afraid they would die, as if they had seen God himself. Whenever the text describes an angel appearing to a person, the angel looks like a human being. In all but one case the angel never eats. In some passages the person does not realise the person he or she is talking to is an angel until after the angel has left. Angels sometimes disappear in miraculous ways, and that helps the person know it was an angel.The spirit-being sent by God often did more than one thing. Sometimes he brought a message and protected, or guided and protected, or protected one party while attacking/destroying another (as with Lot and Sodom). Therefore a verse containing |hמַלְאָךְ|h* might be listed below under more than one category of meaning.

\freq 64
\sub בֹר
\intro 1. The primary meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is a cistern, a hole dug in the ground to hold water. The hole or pit was sometimes used as place to imprison people. |hבּוֹר|h* also means prison. However, the prison is not clearly underground so it is not necessarily a dungeon. 2. A figurative meaning is the underworld which is underground, the place where the dead continue exististence, like |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. It is not a grave where dead bodies are buried. The darkness, depth, and unpleasantness of an old, unused cistern could have evoked the place where dead people were. |hבּוֹר|h* is used primarily in a phrase 'those going down to the underworld' as a metonymy for death. All the occurrances are a metaphorical way of referring to death.
\tnotes When it means the underworld, this word is used almost exclusively in the phrase |hיֹורְדֵי בֹור|h* 'those going down to the underworld'. The whole phrase is a metonymy for dying. In the other occurrances, |hבּוֹר|h* itself is the metonymy for death.There is no sense of punishment in this underworld, so words for underworld which involve punishment are not appropriate translations, such as hell. Words for grave could be used when they are a metonymy for death, as they are in English.
\hebraist |hבּוֹר|h* is used primarily in the phrase |hיֹורְדֵי בֹור|h*. This phrase is introduced by the object marker |hאֶת|h* or by the prepositions |hעִם|h*, |hמִן|h*, or |hכּ|h*. |hבּוֹר|h* is always the goal of the verb. When meaning the underworld, the term is used soley in the poetic genre.
\altint Many translations gloss |hבּוֹר|h* with either ‘death’ or ‘grave’. BDB, Raymond, Even-Shoshan give the gloss of 'grave'. IVPBBC gives 'underworld' and 'grave'. Note that all of the occurrances of |hבּוֹר|h* as the underworld are in poetic genre and are a metonymy for death. In English 'grave' is also a metonymy for death.
\evalev The term |hבּוֹר|h* is used almost exclusively with the verb |hירד|h*. This verb is also used with other words for the underworld, but never with the words for grave,  |hקְבוּרָה|h* and |hקֶבֶר|h*, and only once with |h‫מָוֶת‬|h*. The meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is thus most likely 'underworld' rather than 'grave'. Words for grave, underworld, and death are used in similar contexts since they all have to do with death. A person goes down to the underworld at death, and the body is buried at that time. |hבּוֹר|h*  and |h‫מָוֶת‬|h* are used in parallel only three times, and one of these is also with |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. Thus their juxtaposition does not necessarily imply that |hבּוֹר|h* means grave. A menonymous use of |hבּוֹר|h* is a more likely explanation for the evocation of death.
\comp 1. The literal meaning   Frame: Water: Water storage2. A metaphorical extention of Meaning 1  Frame: Imprisonment3. A metaphorical extention of Meaning 1  Frame: Death
\dfnotes The primary meaning of |hבּוֹר|h* is a cistern, a hole dug in the ground or rock to hold water. After the cistern was no longer used or usable for water storage, it was sometimes used as a place of imprisonment. By figurative extension, the same word was used for prison or dungeon. Another figurative use was as a name for the underworld, or place where dead people were. The underworld was seen as underground, and dark, like the inside of a cistern. In this meaning |hבּוֹר|h* does not seem to be a place of punishment. Death is not a positive thing, and dying is the punishment. The idea of imprisonment is associated with two other words for the underworld, |hשְׁאוֹל|h* and |hשַׁחַת|h*.The psalmists speak of |hבּוֹר|h* in relation to life and rescue from death and from enemies. The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both speak of |hבּוֹר|h* in the context of punishment. Part of the punishment of God on the surrounding nations is to send their leaders to |hבּוֹר|h*, often used in parallel with |hשְׁאוֹל|h*. Death itself is the punishment because it is a humiliation of those who were leaders and in high position.The most important characteristics of the underworld for the Hebrews were that it was a dark and distanct place underground where the dead people continued their existence. Hebrew uses five terms to refer to it: |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, |hאֲבַדּוֹן|h*, |hשַׁחַת|h*, |hבְּאֵר|h* and |hבּוֹר|h*, and two phrases: |h‫אֶרֶץ נְשִׁיָּֽה |h* (Psa 88:13) and |h‫אֶרֶץ תַּחְתִּיֹּ֖ות‬|h* (Ezk 32:18). It had some characteristics of a prison, like bars and gates, but it was not seen as a place of punishment.

\context The underworld as a metonymy for death
\syntagcc All references for |hבּוֹר |h* as the underworld are in the poetic genre. Although the word refers to the underworld as a place, it is used in the context of death or possible death of the speaker or the person referred to. Often there is a comparison of the troubles of the speaker with one who is dead or 'has gone down to the underworld'. Hence there is often a plea to God to rescue the person from the underworld, or rather, from the troubles the person is enduring. In all but four occurrances, |hבּוֹר |h*  is used within a structured phrase: |hיֹורְדֵי בֹֽור |h* 'those who go down to the underworld'. A phrase which is a metonymy for death in the target language is a possible translations of this phrase. The word 'death' can also be used.

\eval Most translations consulted use the term 'the pit', which does not convey the emotion of the psalmist.

TEV refers directly to the world of the dead, which also evokes the negative emotions associated with death and the underworld, but in English the emotional impact is less strong.

\not (a) Possible meaning. Some translations take |hבּוֹר|h* to mean 'pit' or 'hole' in Prov 28:17, not the underworld. The TOB translates it as 'prison'. Both are possible meanings. KTBH prefers the meaning underworld as a metonymy for death, as in the NRSV, TEV, and FLC among others. The preposition |hעַד |h*implies a a physical distance, which fit into the idea of the underworld being far away, as well as a temporal distance, that is until death. This metonymous use of underworld fits with the other occurances of |hבּוֹר|h* as underworld that are metonomies for death.

\not (b) In Isa 14:19 |hבּוֹר |h* is taken by some translations and lexicons to be the underworld. However, it is also translated as a cistern where dead bodies are thrown instead of being buried. |hבּוֹר |h* is repeated four times in this section. This occurrance of |hבּוֹר |h* comes in the midst of Isaiah's prophecy about the defeat and punishment of the surrounding nations. The leaders will all end up in the underworld.This verse appears to use a play on words of the several meanings of |hבּוֹר |h*. Isaiah is making a unique point about the king of Babylonia who considered himself better than all the other nations and kings. Isaiah's prophecy is that he is no better than any of the other kings. His fate is even worse than that of the surrounding nations. Not only will he die and meet the other kings in the underworld, he will not be buried appropriately in a grave like other dead leaders.  His body will simply be thorwn into a pit with other corpses. This was a very shameful thing to have happen to him. The more lavish a funeral and burial rites, the more important a leader was considered to be. His burial reflected how much honor he had among the people.

\intro 1. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is the name of the place where the dead are. It is part of the universe, under the earth, inaccessible to living humans, yet God can see into |hשְׁאוֹל |h*and knows all about it.2. Death is a negative thing because it separates one from society, family, and from God. So |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is also a negative place since one who is there is separated from society and from God. It is not a place of judgement, nor of punishment.3. The phrase |hירד שְׁאוֹל|h* 'go down to the underworld' is a metonymy for death, or possibly a euphemism for death. As a metonymy, it is used primarily in the speech of individuals in narrative portions, and in poetry. It is often used in parallel with other words for the underworld, such as |hשַׁחַת|h* and |hבּוּר|h*, and with the word |hמָוֶת|h*.4. In Proverbs, |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is the underworld, and is used mainly as a metaphor for the consquences of a wasteful or evil life or the living of an evil life which leads to death. 5. The use of the term |hשְׁאוֹל |h*in poetic and prophetic sections is varied. Sometimes it is personified, sometimes it refers specifically to the place where the dead are, sometimes it refers to death.
\tnotes 1. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was a literal place within the Hebrew cosmos. It is underground, the place where the dead are located after death. The Hebrews believed that the dead continued to exist in this underworld, but had no further contact with the surface of the earth or those still living. There was no intermediate place where the dead spent time. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was the only location of those who were dead.2. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*was not a place of judgement or punishment for the Hebrews. Any word in the target language which evokes these ideas, e.g. 'hell' or |ienfer|i* should be avoided. Some of the prophets and psalmists viewed death itself as part of God's punishment, as in Psalm 9:18, Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 31. The punishment is in the loss of honor and importance in the world rather than anything that takes place in the underworld after death.3. The place of the dead and death itself are very closely tied together in the Hebrew text. The implicit domain for |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is Death. |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is often used with the word |hמַוֶת|h*, and with other metonymous phrases for death, such as רִמָּה. In the poetic and prophetic passages, the use of the terms for death and the place of the dead are found in parallel and often used as synonyms.  4. The Hebrews used the expression   |hירד שְׁאוֹל |h*to refer to the death of a person. It is possibly a euphemism. The names of the underworld itself, including |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, were used as metonymies for death. Some translations, e.g. CEV, NLT, and NIV, always take |hשְׁאוֹל |h*as a figurative expression for death or the grave. Only where |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is a metonymy for death is this a good alternative. Metonymies in the target languages could also be used. Where |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is referring to the literal place where the dead are within the cosmos, a term for the underworld in the target language is a preferable, if the term is a place underground. If not, a phrase like 'world of the dead' is appropriate. 5. Ezekiel and Isaiah describe the underworld in several prophecies. The kings of the nations which surround Israel are described in the underworld with their honour and importance gone. Because these are prophetic passages, they should not be taken as literal descriptions of what |hשְׁאוֹל |h*is like. The prophecies are descriptions of God's punishment of these evil nations, using the images of the underworld to emphasize how they will loose all their glory and importance when they die.
\hebraist The verb |hירד|h* is used with |hשְׁאוֹל |h*as goal or location to describe the death event. Thus to be saved from death, or to live, uses the verb |hצלה|h*, to go up. Synonyms for |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, such as |h‫שָׁחַת|h* and |h‫בּוּר‬ |h*both also use these verbs. The words |h‫קבֶרֶ‬|h*, |h‫קְבוּרָה‬ |h*or  |h‫מָוֶת‬|h* never use these verbs.
\altint Some commentators equate |hשְׁאוֹל|h* with the grave, as do the NIV. NIDOTTE gives the meaning as both the grave and the underworld because |hשְׁאוֹל|h* collocates with |hאֲבַדֹּון|h* and is used in parallel with |hבּוּר|h* and |hמָוֶת|h*. Although in English 'the grave' can be a euphemism for death, this is not the case in Hebrew. The grave is associated with death because the dead body is put in the grave. But the part of the person that continues existing goes to |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, the underworld. The verb |hירד|h* is used with words for the underworld, but not with words for the grave. Neither are terms for grave used as synonyms for the underworld. Some resemblance between the structure of graves and of |hשְׁאוֹל|h* in implied in various passages. Amos 9:2 implies that one can dig into |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, but the focus here is that the underworld is part of the universe which God knows all about. Words for grave are never used to name parts of the universe.
\comp 1. The place Frame: Universe2. Metonymous use of Meaning 1 Frame: Death
\dfnotes 1. In Meaning 1, the focus is on the location of the underworld in relation to other places in the universe. It is part of the cosmos, evoking the universe domain. All occurrances are in poetry or prophecy.2. In Meaning 2, the word for the underworld refers to the event of death. One dies when one goes down [|hירד|h*] to the underworld. God or a human can send someone down, and a human can go down. Someone who is in the underworld has already died. The people in the underworld are insubstantial, they fade away as a cloud, they are shades. It is a dark place, underground, yet God can see into it and knows all about it. No one can hide from God in the underworld. It is contrasted with both heaven and the earth, the land of the living.3. The underworld is also a metaphor for the danger and fear of death. The Psalmists beg God to deliver them from |hשְׁאוֹל|h*, that is, from death.  The danger of living an evil life is compared to death. Thus, the death event is used as a metaphor for a live of evil.

Other translations use Sheol, the name of the underworld, which is a transliteration of the Hebrew name, but has no meaning to a non-Hebrew audience.

\syntagcc The phrase |hירד שְׁאוֹל|h* is a metonymy for death, and possibly a euphemism for death.

NIV uses 'grave', which is also acceptable in this context since 'the grave' is an English metonymy for death.

\not (a) Psalm 55:16 uses the same phrase as Num 16:30, 33, 'go down to Sheol alive' [|hירד שְׁאוֹל חַיִּים|h*]. These three verses are the only places this phrase is used. In Numbers, some members of the clan of Kohath of the tribe of Levi challenged the leadership of Moses. They wanted to offer sacrifices just as the priests did. To restore the authority of Moses, God gave the sign that the ground opened up and the families who had challenged Moses 'went down alive to Sheol' [|hיָרְדוּ חַיִּים שְׁאֹלָה|h*]. In Psalm 55, the psalmist complains to God about his companions and close friends who betrayed him, just as the Levites who were the same tribe as Moses betrayed Moses by challenging his authority. So the psalmist asks God to justify him by causing his betrayers to 'go down to Sheol alive' [|hיֵרְדוּ שְׁאֹול חַיִּים|h*] in the same way that God acted for Moses.

\not (b) Psa 49:15 has considerable textual issues. The verb associated with the second occurrence of שְׁאֹול has a Masoretic pointing of piel, which is rendered as 'for the consuming of Sheol'. In this case Sheol is personified as one who consumes the bodies or forms of the evil people.Both the BHS and HALOT propose an alternative pointing in qal, hence an intransitive verb. This renders the phrase 'to wear out in Sheol'.  Some manuscripts have emended the verb to לכלות, which is rendered 'to fade away in Sheol'. In both these cases, Sheol is not personified but is a location, with the implication of death. There is also the question of whether the word |שְׁאֹול|h* should be read with the verb that precedes it or with the phrase that succeeds it.A slight majority of English translations looked at prefer a rendering of the last phrase as something like 'they waste away in Sheol without honor'. The French translations seem to prefer a rendering of 'and Sheol shall be their home'. Instead of a personification of Sheol who consumes people, the verb |hבלה|h* is interpreted to refer to the decomposition which affects the body after death.
\notfr (b) NOTE This verse is very difficult to understand. The majority of translations translate the last phrase as something like 'Sheol shall be their home'.

\not (c) The Hebrew text of Psa 141:7 is obscure. The phrase |hלְפִי שְׁאֹול|h* could be a personification of |hשְׁאֹול|h*, or it could be the entrance to the underworld. The WBC suggests an analogy of |hשְׁאֹול|h* with the Ugaritic god Mot who devours his victims and leaves the bones scattered at his mouth. Here |hשְׁאֹול|h* is personified as a monster who eats his victims.

\sub שׁוח
\intro 1. The primary meaning of |hשַׁחַת|h* is a hole in the ground which is used for a trap.2. Used metaphorically, |hשַׁחַת|h* means the underworld, a place no one can leave, so a kind of trap. 3. When used metaphorically, the concept of the underworld is often a metonomy for death. Either the word itself or a whole phrase such as |hתִּקְרַב לַשַּׁחַת|h* 'it drew near to |hשַׁחַת|h*' can be the metonomy.
\tnotes The netherworld, the place of the dead, was seen as underground by the Hebews. It is not the same as the grave where dead bodies are put. It is also not a place of punishment, so words like 'hell' where punishment in the underworld takes place are not appropriate.All the words for underworld are used metaphorically to refer to the event of death. |hשַׁחַת|h* is used often with the words |hחַיָּה|h*  (life) and |hנֶפֶש|h* ׁ (soul), in phrases like 'abandon my life to |hשַׁחַת|h*'. The whole phrase is a metonomy for death.
\evalev The words for the underworld use the verb |hירד|h*, as opposed to words for a burial place which do not use this verb.
\comp 1. The literal object.   Frame: Hunting2. Metaphorical use of Meaning 1.   Frame: Death
\dfnotes 1. The literal object is a hole in the ground, a pit used as a trap. 2. A metaphorical extention of meaning 1 is the underworld, the dark underground place where the dead are, a trap from which one must escape in order to continue living in the light. Death seems to be a journey that leads to |hשַׁחַת|h*, and this journey can be reversed or interrupted before the final destination is reached. The word |hשַׁחַת|h* by itself or phrases using |hשַׁחַת|h* are a metonymy or euphemism for death. One can be redeemed or ransomed from |hשַׁחַת|h*, or brought up from |hשַׁחַת|h*, kept back from |hשַׁחַת|h*, or not see |hשַׁחַת|h*, thus one does not experience death.

\gloss altar
\freq 403
\sub זבח
\intro 1. This word refers to an elevated physical structure dedicated to the worship of a deity.2. The elevated structure was a platform made of packed earth, piled stones, cut stones, wood overlaid or plated with a metal such as bronze or gold. The Israelites were not permitted to build an altar of cut stones (Exo 20:25).3. The structure was normally used as a stand for burning animal sacrifices or cereal offerings. An altar could also serve as a memorial marker, or as a place of refuge. The word also referred to a stand for burning incense.4. The structure was high enough to allow the officiator to work on it while standing at its base. In some cases, the structure was built in stages that required the officiator to mount steps to be able to work on it. The people of Israel were forbidden to build such altars (Exo 20:26).5. In the Old Testament, the word most frequently refers to the altar of burnt offering which stood in the tabernacle or temple just before the entrance to the sanctuary. This altar was eventually promoted as the only legitimate place to offer animal sacrifice and cereal offerings to the God of Israel. In the tabernacle, this altar was made of acacia wood overlaid by bronze. The temple altar is referred to as the bronze altar, but it is not clear whether it was made entirely of bronze or of wood overlaid with bronze.6. The word, especially when used in the plural, can refer to altars for pagan worship, such as for the worship of Baal.7. The word can also refer to the altar of incense which stood in the sanctuary of the tabernacle or the temple and served as a brazier for burning incense. In the tabernacle this was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. In the temple, it is sometimes referred to as the gold altar.8. In certain contexts, an altar was built as a memorial marker, not as a platform for burning sacrifices or incense. In addition to serving as a platform for burning sacrifice or incense, it also served the function of a place of refuge from vengeance killing in cases of manslaughter.
\tnotes Care needs to taken when translating 'altar' in Tazi contexts. Any large animal killed for food is ritually 'sacrificed' and it is done on a floor set apart for that purpose. So a substantive referring to 'place of sacrifice' usually refers to a floor where a butcher works. It bears no resemblance to the physical structure of Old Testament altars and does not suggest an object used for worship.In traditional Christian contexts, churches of liturgical background may include a raised structure that is called an 'altar'. But care must be taken in these cases, as well. There are valid metaphorical comparisons between a Christian altar and the kinds of altar that were used in  Israelite worship. But in terms of actual form and function there are very significant differences. It would be helpful to the translator to look for pictures or diagrams of Old Testament altars in Bible dictionaries or handbooks before they decide on the proper description or designation of an altar in their translation.
\hebraist |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* is a noun derived from the verb |hזבח|h* 'to slaughter, to sacrifice' using a |hם |h*preformitive . Such nouns 'are mainly abstract nouns, nouns of place and nouns of instrument' (Joüon and Muraoka 1993; §88Ld). In the vast majority of occurrences, |hמִזְבֵּח|h* is not abstract, but is referring to a concrete structure. However, an altar is a place of sacrifice.
\comp All occurrences of |hמִזְבֵּחַ|h* make reference to a physical structure. The primary function of the structure was to provide a platform for burning sacrifices and offerings. This primary function is clear in the first three meanings. Meaning 1 refers to altars that were built by the patriarchs in a variety of places, in a practice that was continued well after the development of the official cult centered around the altars in  the Tabernacle and the Temple, especially in the Northern Kingdom. A contextual use distinction was made for the altar that was built on Mount Ebal at the time the Israelites entered the land. It functions as both a place of sacrifice and as a memorial to the covenant law that had been established between God and the people while they were in the desert.Meaning 2 refers to the bronze altar that was a focus of official worship when the Tabernacle and later the Temple were established and the priesthood was instituted. Contextual uses were distinguished for the different altars in the Tabernacle and the various versions of the Temple. In addition, these altars could serve as a point of refuge and become references for expressions that refer to the activities of priesthood or congregational worship.Meaning 3 refers to altars that were dedicated to pagan gods. One contextual use is distinguished where the altar in Bethel is personified as the focus of guilt for northern kingdom's apostacy and as a result is punished.Meaning 4 refers to the altar that was built by the eastern tribes following the conquest. The western tribes interpreted its function as that of sacrifice. The eastern tribes insisted that it was built only as a reminder. The western tribes accepted that explanation which indicates that 'memorial' was an understood secondary function of a patriarchal style altar.Meaning 5 refers to the incense burner that was built for the Tabarnacle and the Temple. It did not function as a place of sacrifice, but the burning of incense was probably viewed as analagous to the burning of the animal sacrifices and cereal offerings, allowing the term 'altar' to be extended to refer to 'the altar of incense'.
\dfnotes The word 'altar' evokes the frame of Sacrifice and that frame unites all of the meanings even if only by analogy in the case of Meaning 5.  Though the frame is the same throughout, domains of patriarchal religion, priesthood, pagan religion, memorial, and purification rituals distinguish the various meanings of the word.

In the case of Adonijah the altar is not specifically named. In the case of Joab, it is the altar in the Tabernacle (the tent of the LORD). So, it seems likely that Adonijah also fled to the altar in the tabernacle.

\eval In the Hebrew the prophet adresses the altar: 'Altar! Altar!' and the rest of prophecy refers to the altar in the second person. Most of the translations translate the personification literally. However, in a language where the personification is unnatural or misunderstood, it would be possible to follow the CEV. It removes the personification and changes the reference from 2nd person to 3rd person.

\meaning Altar built as a memorial marker to the God of Israel, not as a platform for offering sacrifice.
\frame Sacrifice
\domain Memorial
\syntagc An altar is prototypically understood as a place of sacrifice. But it could also serve as a memorial marker. Such a function is implicit in many of the contexts for Meaning 1. The altars are built on locations of significant interaction with God, often there is no mention of sacrifice being made, and one of the functions may be to remind those who follow of what happened. Exodus 20:24 refers to the altar as a "place where I cause my name to be remembered" (RSV). But the only place where an altar's function as a memorial marker is asserted and distinguished from its function as a place of sacrifice is in Joshua 22. In this passage, it is clear that the function as a place of sacrifice is what comes to mind when the western tribes hear that the eastern tribes are building their own altar. But they accept the eastern tribes assertion that the altar is only to serve as a memorial.

\meaning Incense burner, or altar of incense, a raised structure used by the High Priest for burning incense to establish holiness within the sanctuary

\eventfr Event =to burn incenseAgent =High PriestPatient =incenseBeneficiary =High PriestLocation =headword
\syntagc No sacrifice is done on the altar of incense. It is probably referred to as an altar because the burning of incense and the going up of its smoke is comparable to the burning of a sacrifice and the going up of its smoke. In addition it is comparable in shape, being square in its cross-section with upturned corners, called horns. It is likely that the burning of incense was viewed as analogous to the burning of a sacrifice.The actual function of the incense burned on the altar is not clearly described. In Exodus 30:7,8, the high priest is to offer incense on the altar when he goes into the sanctuary every morning and evening to take care of the lamps. In Leviticus 16:12-13, when the high priest enters the sanctuary to sprinkle blood on the covenant box, he is to bring in coals and incense, and burn the incense on the fire (the word 'altar' is not actually used in this instance). 'The smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony, so that he will not die' (Lev 16:13, NIV). Nielsen comments 'This incense cloud provides the high priest with cover against the divine wrath or the divine “radiation.” The incense smoke gives protection.'|nr|n* Another way to put this is to say that the incense smoke establishes holiness.

\not (k) Jeroboam set up shrines with calf idols at Dan and Bethel to try to draw his people away from worship in Jerusalem. The calf idol and Jeroboam's words echo those of Aaron in Exo 32:4. Apparently the altar at the shrine of Bethel became a significant focus of worship for Jeroboam's state religion. Jeroboam may have tried to claim that it was Yahwistic worship. But that claim was rejected by prophets who would condemn the practice.

But it leads to confusion with the Temple in Jerusalem. CEV translates 'the temple altar' but footnotes it with 'The one at Bethel'. De Waard and Smalley (A TRANSLATOR'S HANDBOOK on The Book of Amos, New York, UBS1979, electronic) also identify this with the altar in the temple in Bethel.

\sub קַנָּא, קִנְאָה
\intro |hקנא|h* means to become angry in response to a challenge to one's honour.1) A person can cause another to become angry by challenging their honour;2) A person can become angry by something specific that another person does to challenge one's honour;3) A person can become angry when another person represents a challenge to one's honour, even though the other person has not intentionally sought to challenge one's honour;4) A person can become angry in behalf of someone else whose honour has been challenged.
\tnotes Traditional English translations of |hקנא|h* use expressions such as 'to be jealous' or 'to envy'. In some contexts, such as Numbers, chapter 5, these expressions are appropriate. But in many others they are misleading, because evoke the Frames of Hatred, Ownership, or Desire rather than the Frames of Anger and Honour / Shame. More modern English translations use general words, like 'passion' or 'to be passionate'. In so doing they evoke the emotional intensity of |hקנא|h* but they don't help the reader to understand the reason for the intense emotion. The reason for the intense emotion would have been clear to a Hebrew speaker. |hקנא|h* is an understandable, but not always appropriate, response to an honour challenge. The OT understands this response well, but is ambivalent about whether it is always a desirable response.Because |hקנא|h* evokes two Frames and there is no comparable term in English, it may be necessary to use two or more words to carry the same semantic content. The translator would be wise to explore the semantic domain of Honour / Shame as well as Anger within the audience culture. If honour, and avoidance of shame, is a high value, then there may be a cultural equivalent of an agressive response to someone who challenges one's honour. If not, the KTBH translations offered here may provide helpful suggestions.
\hebraist The verb is found in the Piel stem (30x) and in the Hiphil stem (4x). The Hiphil stem expresses a causative relationship (someone causes someone else to become angry). In two occurrences the syntax and context indicates that the Piel stem should be understood as causative (Deu 32:21 and 1Ki 14:22). The meaning of the word shifts according to whether the verb is transitive or intransitive, and whether
\comp All of the meanings and uses described below evoke the same cognitive scenario: a-B challenges the reputation or honour of A b-A is threatened with shame. c-A |bexperiences anger|b*. d-A expresses that anger and attempts to reestablish his or her reputation.|hקנא|h* refers specifically to the experience of anger but brings to mind the whole scenario.There can be variations on the scenario. The challenge to honour may be attributed to the actions of a group or type of people, or it may be a more general state of affairs. The challenge to honour may be intentional or unintentional. In some cases, B does nothing to create a challenge; A simply feels threatened by B's status or reputation. Finally, B may challenge the reputation of C, but it is A that feels the anger on behalf of C. Protecting the reputation of someone else happens due to the close relationships between patrons and clients in Ancient Near Eastern social order.Different aspects of the scenario are brought into focus by how the scenario is expressed grammatically and these affect the nuance of meaning of the expression.Meaning 1: When the verb is transitive and modified by a |hבְּ|h* prepositional phrase, B causes A to experience |hקנא|h* |iwhen|i* B does certain things. (All causative (|ihiphil|i*) forms of the verb are transitive. There are two |ipiel|i* forms that are interpreted as causative because they fit this pattern as well.)Meaning 2: When the verb is intransitive and modified by a |hבְּ|h* prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* |iwhen|i* B does certain things or |iwhen|i* certain things are done.Meaning 3: When the verb is transitive and not modified by a prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* about B though B has done nothing to provoke a challenge.Meaning 4: When the verb is intransitive and modified by a |hלְ|h* prepositional phrase, A experiences |hקנא|h* on behalf of C (B's role as an Agent is left implicit).Contextual Uses are distinguished either by changes in the participants or by special contextual domains that are brought to mind. So, in Meanings 1 and 4, separate contextual uses are distinguished depending on whether God or humans are Experiencers of |hקנא|h*. Meaning 4 also has distinctions in contextual use depending on whether God or humans are Benefactives. In Meaning 3, different contextual uses are distinguished by whether the Honour challenge is in the context of rivalry for status or in the context of adultery.
\dfnotes |hקנא|h* evokes two Frames: Anger and Honour / Shame. It is used regularly in association with words for anger. The writer of Proverbs classifies it as a form of anger. Anger is an emotional response to a threat to a person's well-being. Various contexts indicate that when |hקנא|h* is used the anger is in response to a threat to a person's honour or status.

\keyverse They |bchallenged the honour|b* of their God and provoked him to anger by worshipping idols and serving in their sanctuaries. (KTBH)
\eval RSV provides a traditional translation: 'For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they |bmoved|b* him |bto jealousy|b* with their graven images'. But the English word 'jealousy' does not naturally lead the reader to think of honour and shame. CEV reads: 'God |bdemanded all their love|b*, but they |bmade him angry|b* by worshiping idols. (CEV)' The CEV avoids the word 'jealousy'. Its use of the phrase 'God demanded all their love' may be meaningful for an English audience, but it evokes the domain of marriage which is only a small part of the use of the word, |hקנא|h*. It may actually be misleading for non-Western languages which have a vocabulary for honour and challenges to honour. The KTBH translation makes the frame of Honour / Shame explicit in the translation and allows the anger word in the parallel line to carry the frame of Anger. It also rearranges the parallelism to make the cause and effect order more apparent. The parallelism could be retained by translating: 'They provoked God to anger by serving in sanctuaries of other gods; they |bchallenged his honour|b* by worshipping idols'.

But in modern English, jealousy evokes the frames of possession or selfishness, not that of honour. It is possible to reframe a challenge to honour as an attempt to shame.

\syntagcc In the wisdom literature, |hקנא|h* looses some of the intensity of its anger. Anger may turn inward and become bitterness or frustration. But the sense of an honour challenge is still there. Wealth or success contributes to honour. And wicked men are often successful or wealthy. Such success challenges the honour of the wise man (Psalm 73:3). The wise man is tempted to become angry and embittered (Psalm 37:1; Proverbs 24:19). Most English translations use 'envy' to translate |hקנא|h* in these passages. It is possible that bitterness leads the wiseman to desire to imitate the 'successful' ways of the wicked (Proverbs 3:31, 24:1) and that is what is being expressed in these passages. But these would be unusual uses of the word. All of these passages make sense if |hקנא|h* is understood as an emotion leading to suppressed anger, or bitterness.

\keyverse For I |bfelt shamed|b* by the arrogant, |bbitter|b* when I saw that their wickedness made them prosperous. (KTBH)
\eval The RSV reads: 'For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked'. Arrogance is a negative quality. So, it is not at all clear why a person would be envious of the arrogant, since it would imply that the psalmist is attracted to the arrogant. But that makes no sense in the context. The KTBH translation tries to bring out the comparison the psalmist is making between his own life and that of the arrogant. They seem to have prospered and been honoured, while he has suffered and been dishonoured. He wonders whether he has lived a wise life in vain (see verse 13).

\syntagcc In both of these passages the object of the prepositional phrase is a person. But the use of the preposition indicates a different realization of the scenario than if the person is the simple object of the verb (see Meaning 3). In both instances the context indicates that the Effectors have definitely provoked the anger of the Experiencers. Leah boasts of her fertility in the face of her rival, Rachel. Joseph, perhaps very naively, boasts to his brothers of his dreams that predict that they will be giving him honour.

\keyverse Rachel had not borne Jacob any children. She was |bshamed|b* by this and |bprovoked to anger|b* by her sister. She said to Jacob: "Give me sons or I will die!" (KTBH)
\eval RSV translates: 'When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!"' The word 'envied' seems weak in light of the context. CEV translates: 'Rachel was very jealous of Leah for having children, and she said to Jacob, “I'll die if you don't give me some children!”' This translation indicates the intensity of Rachel's emotion, but 'jealousy' doesn't carry a sense of provocation. The phrase, 'She saw that she had not borne Jacob any children', hints that Rachel perceived that her infertility had become a public talking point. As a result, she was shamed and responded to her sister's provocation with anger, directed at Jacob. Jacob's reaction to Rachel's implicit slight of his honour is anger in response to her anger.

\eval Many versions translate 'great' as 'wealthy', which is a legitimate translation in this context. For an English-speaker that then makes sense of the translation of 'the Philistines envied him'. But it doesn't help explain the Philistine reaction. Rather than try to appropriate his goods, they disable his wells and ask him to leave the region (following translations like NIV, TEV, CEV). 'To be great' is 'to have honour' and the Philistines were threatened to the point of anger in comparison to him. So they shamed him and made him leave the region.

In 1 Kings 19:10 & 14, Elijah says,'Being zealous I have been zealous for the LORD'. In either situation we could say that Phineas or Elijah were very zealous to defend God's honour.

\keyverse He and his descendants are permanently established as priests, because he |bpassionately defended my honour|b* and brought about forgiveness for the people's sin. (KTBH)
\eval NIV's '|ihe was zealous for the honor of his God'|i* is a nice translation, though it is a bit scholarly. TEV's '|ihe did not tolerate any rivals to me|i*' is a good example of a possible rendering of |hקנא|h* here, as in several other places. And it does suggest the emtional intensity. However, TEV uses a sort of double negative ('to not tolerate any rivals') which actually gives a negative connotation to the expression. Since tolerance is a very high positive value in Western cultures, to suggest that God isn't tolerant may be seen negatively. The KTBH translation presents Phineas' reaction in a positive manner.

\eval The last part of verse 17 is included to show the prior context. Mockery and taunting are shaming actions. The question "Where is your God?" shames the client by casting doubts on the honor of the patron. NJPS's 'Then the Lord was roused on behalf of His land' indicates God's emotional response, but it is an intensity without content. God's response is anger toward his people's rival and compassion for his people.

\not (a) The |iHiphil|i* participle is modifying the phrase 'the idol of jealousy' and is usually translated as a relative clause 'the idol of jealousy which provokes to jealousy'. The expression is figurative. The idol isn't the Agent of provocation, since it is an inanimate object. Rather it is those who make or worship the idol that provoke God to anger. So, a possible translation would be: '...where the shameful idol stands. Those who worship it provoke God to anger. (KTBH) The advantage of such a translation is that it evokes both the frames of Anger and Honour / Shame, and it avoids the redundancy of a literal translation.

\intro |hקִנְאָה|h* refers to the experience of becoming angry or anxious in response to a challenge to one's honour.1) A person can provoke another to anger by challenging their honour;2) A person can experience anger or anxiety in response to a challenge to honor;3) A person can be provoked to anger in behalf of someone else whose honour has been challenged.
\tnotes Traditional English translations of |hקִנְאָה|h* use terms such as 'jealousy' or 'envy'. They are often misleading because they evoke the frames of ownership, possessiveness, or selfishness for an English speaker, rather than the frame of honour or reputation. In some contexts such as Number 5, 'jealousy' might be an appropriate translation, but in many others, English translations of 'jealousy' or 'envy' make little sense. Modern English translations often use general words, like 'passion'. In so doing they evoke the emotional intensity of |hקִנְאָה|h* but they don't help the reader to understand the reason for the intense emotion. The reason for the intense emotion would have been clear to a Hebrew speaker.The translator would be wise to explore the semantic domain of honour/shame within the audience culture. If honour, and avoidance of shame, is a high value, then there may be a cultural equivalent of an agressive response to something that challenges one's honour. |hקִנְאָה|h* is an understandable, but not always appropriate, response to an honour challenge. The OT understands this response well, but does not always see it as a desirable response.
\hebraist |hקִנְאָה|h* is an abstract noun formed from the verb |hקנא|h*. It expresses the event of being provoked to anger over a challenge to honour or the state of being angry due to an honour challenge. It can be absolute noun, the head of a construct phrase, or a construct noun itself. It is only modified by an adjective twice, both times in Zechariah by the adjective |hגָּדוֹל |h*(1:14, 8:2). It can serve as the object of the preposition |hב־|h* (5x), and of the preposition |hכ־|h* (1x). It can be modified by a personal possessive pronoun. In all cases the possessive pronoun refers to the experiencer of the emotion. When |hקִנְאָה |h*is the head of a construct phrase the noun in construct may refer to the experiencer (c.f., Ecclesiastes 4:4), or to the beneficiary of the emotion (c.f., Psalm 69:10). Context determines whether the pronoun should be understood as experiencer or beneficiary.  |hקִנְאָה|h* only occurs in the plural in Numbers 5 where it is a part of two different technical terms: 'offering of jealousies' or 'ritual of jealousies'.

\frame Anger; Honour / Shame
\domain Idolatry
\gram |hקִנְאָה|h* serves as absolute noun in construct with |hסֶמֶל|h* (idol). The construct noun encodes the agent, the absolute noun the experience of anger. The experiencer and effector are determined by context.

(RSV)...where the idol which shames God stands. Those who worship it provoke God to anger. (author's translation)
\eval RSV provides a literal, traditional translation. If such a translation doesn't work well, it would be possible to unpack the image according to the author's translation. The two different occurrences of the |hקנא|h* root are translated so as to bring out the two different aspects of the root: honour/shame and anger.

\syntagcc |hקִנְאָה |h*is used in a general way. The participant roles are not usually very clear. Meaning is determined by context. In most cases it is fairly clear that a man's competition with his rivals for honour or status is what is in focus.

\eval RSV's 'envy' is not a bad translation, here. But it does seem a little weak. REB's 'rivalry' fits the context much better and underlines the idea of competition for status or honour.

\syntagcc In both cases, the context indicates that God is preparing to act on behalf of his people. So, there is a sense in which these two occurrences could be put into meaning 3.

(RSV)...because it is an offering from a suspicious husband, made to bring the truth to light. (TEV)
\eval The RSV is quite literal and ignores the secondary sense of the |ihiphil |i*of |hזכר|h* (to remember). It can mean 'to make known' (HALOT). That's clearly the meaning of the word in this context. The offering and the ritual that goes along with it are designed to determine whether or not the wife is guilty of adultery and so to relieve the husband of the anxiety that his honour has been defiled by his wife.

\keyverse Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself; and they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my jealousy, when I spend my fury upon them. (RSV)You will feel all the force of my anger and rage until I am satisfied. When all this happens, you will be convinced that I, the LORD, have spoken to you because I am outraged at your unfaithfulness. (TEV)...because I am outraged at the shame that you have brought on me. (author's translation)
\eval The TEV provides an interesting translation. They assume that |hקנא|h* is drawing on the metaphor of adultery. That is not a necessary understanding, if one understand the frame of honour and shame. The disobedience of a client would challenge the honour of the patron.

\keyverse You shall |bsell |b*me food for money, so that I may eat, and supply me water for money, so that I may drink. Only allow me to pass through on foot-- (NRS)
\eval Many English translations translate |hשׁבר |h*with 'to sell' (NRS, RSV, NIV, CEV). Other English translations shift the focus from the perspective of the seller to the perspective of the buyer and use the translation 'to pay for' ( REB, TEV) or 'to supply for money' (NJPS). This may be due to the social setting and the fact that the use of a term from the seller's perspective may seem unnatural when used by the buyer because it sounds too demanding. CEV makes it sound less like a demand by saying, 'You can even sell us ...'. NJB uses a similar strategy by saying 'I shall eat and pay for the food you choose to sell me'.  The translator is encouraged to compare the terminology used in Deuteronomy 2.28 and 2.6.  The reaction of the king to the request in Deuteronomy 2.28 suggests that the request may have been viewed as a demand rather than as a request, but this may have been due to other factors in the social setting and not due to the choice of terminology in the request.  The use of |hנתן|h* 'give' for the sale of water is similar to terminology used for the negotiation of a commercial transaction in Genesis 23. Because of this, it is best to translate the verse as a polite request and not as a demand if the receptor language distinguishes between these two types of speech.

\eval Most English translations have chosen a literal translation 'broken spirit' (NRS, RSV, NIV, ). The NJPS translation is better in that it has tried to translate the term, i.e., a contrite spirit.  Because there is only one occurrence of this phrase in the Hebrew Bible, it is almost impossible to determine the exact meaning.  The word  'spirit' is used to refer to one's character. The TH recommends the use of the term 'humble', which is the meaning of the idiom 'broken spirit' in English.  In Hebrew, however, there are other idioms that clearly refer to humility, e.g.   'lowly spirit'. Because of the context in Psalms 51.19, i.e., sacrifices that generally refer to the removal of sin or the affects of sin, it is best to choose a translation that will fit with the attitude or character of a person who is seeking forgiveness, e.g. a contrite attitude.

\not (a) The assignment of Hos 4:7 to Meaning 2 presupposes that the MT is followed as suggested in HO TTP and that 'their glory' refers to an attribute of the priests. An additional factor in favour of the assignment of Hos 4:7 to Meaning 2 is the fact that elsewhere in the book (Hos 9:11; 10:5), |hכָּבוֹד |h*is used to refer to an attribute of an item. This interpretation (Meaning 2) is followed by TEV, CEV, RSV, NJPS, and others. Several translations (NIV, NJB, and others) follow a variant text that has a different form of the verb |hמור|h* and interpret 'their Glory' as a name for God. (See the discussion of this verse in WBC.) If this interpretation and textual variant are followed, then this occurrence of |hמור|h* in Hos 4.7 would be assigned to Meaning 1.

\sub מֶכֶר, מִמְכָּר, מִמְכֶּרֶת
\intro 1.  The verb |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ is used most frequently to refer to a commercial transaction that involves the sale of an item (including humans) to another human for a price. 2.  Selling an item involves a change of ownership and control. 3.  These elements of ownership and control allow for the extended usage of the verb מכר ‘to sell’ to refer to God's causing Israel to be defeated in battle (Meaning 2a) and his sending them into exile (Meaning 2b). In addition, the verb מכר ‘to sell’  can be used metaphorically for the rejection of a positive moral value (Meaning 4) and for submitting oneself totally to doing evil (Meaning 3).The final extended meaning (Meaning 5) is uncertain, but seems to refer to the person who is enslaving or exploiting others by a variety of means.
\comp The five meanings of |hמכר|h* ‘to sell’ can be basically divided into two groups. Those occurrences that refer to a literal commercial transaction (Meaning 1) and those that are extensions of Meaning 1 (Meanings 2-5). Meaning 1.  The basic event (focus: the commercial transaction) Meaning 2.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 3.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: control) Meaning 4.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: ownership) Meaning 5.  Extension of Meaning 1 (focus: control)
\dfnotes 1. In Meaning 1 humans sell various items including other humans. This usage triggers the Commercial Transaction frame and the sell sub-frame. The Commercial Transaction frame is used against the background of a variety of domains depending on the item being sold. This includes the Slavery domain and one occurrence that is best understood against the background of the Marriage domain. 2. In Meaning 2, YHWH is selling His people and this use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. One of the background cognitive domains necessary to make this correct interpretation is the 'YHWH is a king' metaphor that is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. YHWH is like a king who has made a treaty with the people of Israel - one that obligates both parties to fulfill certain requirements. When Israel breaks this agreement, by not fulfilling their obligations, then YHWH has the right to respond accordingly. In the context of a king's responsibilities towards his subjects, ‘disown’ means ‘relieve oneself of the responsibility to protect’ which in turn means ‘allow their enemies to defeat them’. The purpose is to punish them for their rebellion. 3. In Meaning 3, a person is selling himself to the control of evil. This use of the verb triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame. This meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Pagan Religions, Evil, and Sin.  A person submits to the control of evil by participating in pagan activities such as divination, child sacrifice, and augury. All of these activities are viewed as evil by God. 4. In Meaning 4, a person is encouraged to not sell truth. This metaphorical use of the verb triggers the Ownership frame and the disown sub-frame. This usage is best understood against the background of the Wisdom/Folly domain. Wise people are those who buy (acquire possession of) truth and do not sell (disown or reject) it. 5. Meaning 5 is uncertain, but it seems to refer to an entity that is enslaving or exploiting another by the use of various kinds of evil activities. This extension of Meaning 1 seen in the participle triggers the Control frame and the submit sub-frame and focuses on the agent of the activity. This extended meaning is best understood against the background of the domains of Exploitation, Slavery, and Evil. An entity (the city of Nineveh who is spoken of as a harlot) causes the Israelites to submit to her control (ie sells them) by means of various evil activities.

\keyverse Because of the countless debaucheries of the prostitute, gracefully alluring, mistress of sorcery, who |benslaves |b*nations through her debaucheries, and peoples through her sorcery, (NRS)
\eval NRS is an acceptable translation of a verse whose specific meaning is uncertain.  Versions vary widely in their translation of this verse, but none of the 8 translations consulted translated מכר ‘to sell’ literally. The main grammatical difficulty in translating this verse is determining the semantic functions of בִּזְנוּנֶיהָ ‘through her debaucheries’ and בִּכְשָׁפֶיהָ ‘through her sorcery’. In most verses with מכר ‘to sell’ the preposition בּ ‘with’ is used to refer to the instrument for which an item is sold, e.g., ‘for twenty pieces of silver’ (Gen 37:28). In at least one verse, the preposition בּ ‘with’ indicates the reason the sale was made, i.e., ‘for your sins’ (Isa 50:1). If the first interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations so that she would be able to commit adultery and magic as a result of the sale. If the second interpretation is chosen, then she was selling the nations because of her adultery and magic. Most translations follow neither of these interpretations. Instead, the phrases are interpreted as the means by which the nations are enslaved or trapped, as in CEV and other versions -- ‘You were nothing more than a prostitute using your magical charms and witchcraft to attract and trap nations’.

\eval Most English translations use a verbal phrase ('he had bought') with or without a literal translation of the word 'its silver'. CEV's translation 'and so were all other men and boys in his household, including his servants and slaves' seems to equate 'servants' with ones born in his household and 'slaves' as ones bought with his money. These would not, however, be the naturally understood equivalents for these terms.  Because of this it would be best not to follow CEV's example.

\keyverse If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption a larger share of the |bprice |b*paid for him. (NIV)
\eval 'The longer the time until then, the more you will have to pay.' (CEV) English translations generally use the term 'price' to translate this meaning of the term. The difference between this meaning and Meaning 1b, may be seen in a comparison of the meaning and the translation of the construct chain מִקְנַת כַּסְפֶּךָ 'purchase of your silver' in Gen 17.12 and the construct chain כֶּסֶף מִקְנָתוֹ 'silver of his purchase' in Lev 25:51. In the first, the focus is on the fact that the slave (Item) was purchased with money. In the second, the focus is on the amount of money (Price) involved in the purchase. In Lev 25:51 the term מִקְנָה ‘purchase’ is translated by terms such as ‘(price) paid for him,’ (NIV, RSV) ‘pay’ (CEV), ‘purchase (price)’ (NRS, TEV, NJPS) ‘sale-price’ (NJB), ‘(sum) for which he sold himself’ (REB). All of these translations are basically adequate.

In one occurrence, most translations seemed to be based on a textual variant that is translated 'to lift up', rather than a meaning related to this verb root. 5.

The translations that have chosen meaning 1 have left the nature of the business of the priest and prophet unstated.

\intro 1.  The verb |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’ is used most frequently to refer to a commercial transaction that involves the acquisition of an item or items (including humans) by a particular person for a price. 2.  Buying an item involves a change of ownership and control. 3. These elements of ownership and control allow for several extended meanings of the verb in which items are acquired not through the exchange of money or other items, but through the effort of the person acquiring the item. The effort expended may be that of childbirth (Meaning 2a), God's effort in redeeming people from slavery or in acquiring something by means of warfare (Meaning 2b), and the effort spent on the acquisition of abstract qualities (e.g. wisdom) by a variety of means (Meaning 2c). 4. The verb |hקנה|h* can also mean 'to create' or 'to bring forth' (Meaning 3). This meaning is an extension of Meaning 2a. Rather than referring to physical birth (childbirth) as the means by which one has ownership and control over another, it refers to an item being brought into existence through the effort of the ‘procreator’. As the result of this creative effort, the creator or ‘procreator’ has ownership and control over the item. In the Hebrew Bible, the ‘procreator’ is always God. The item that is created may be the physical world, a human, the people of Israel, or Wisdom.
\altint The interpretation of |hקנה |h*'to buy, acquire' (Meanings 1 and 2) is seldom controversial.  Commentaries, however, reflect alternative interpretations incases where |hקנה |h*means 'to create' or similar (Meaning 3).  In most major English translations, these five occurrences of |hקנה |h*have been consistently translated ‘to create/ to make’ or ‘creator/maker’ when the heavens and earth are the items that are ‘created’ (Gen 14:19, 22). When other types of items are the patients (humans, the people of Israel, or Wisdom), English translations diverge slightly and a wider variety of terminology is used, but most of the terms are still synonyms for creation. An alternate interpretation, however, is often indicated in the notes.  For instance, in Gen 14:19, 22, the NIV lists ‘possessor’ as the alternate translation for ‘creator’ and in Deu 32:6, the alternate translation is ‘who bought you’. In the main text, the NIV uses creation terminology in all of these verses except for Pro 8:22, where procreation terminology is used, i.e. ‘brought me forth’. In Pro 8:22, the NIV note suggests the translation ‘possessed me’.  The alternate interpretations seen in the NIV notes for the meaning of four of these occurrences would be within the range of the examples discussed in Meaning 1. Because God is the agent in all five occurrences, the meaning would probably be an extension of Meaning 1 because it is not likely that God was envisioned as being a participant in a commercial transaction in which a valued item was given to acquire another item. In Deu 32:6 the presence of synonymous verbs that are not economic in nature (|hכון |h*‘to establish’ and |hעשׂה |h*‘to make’) also point to the metaphorical usage of |hקנה|h*. Furthermore, the LXX points to an early interpretation of |hקנה |h*in these occurrences by its use of the translation equivalent |gκτίζω |g*‘to create’ in three of the verses. This evidence that points to the extended usage of |hקנה |h*to refer to creation does not, however, necessitate the assigning of these meanings to a separate root, as is suggested in some lexicons. Rather, the possibility of alternate interpretations points to the related nature of the concepts of acquisition and creation, i.e. created items are the possessions/acquisitions of the one who created them. This is another example that shows that Hebrew words often have a greater range of meaning than their equivalents in English and other languages. The interpretation of קנה in Pro 8:22 has been especially problematic through the centuries. (See Waltke 2004 for a discussion of the various possible interpretations of this verse.) In Pro 8:22, |hקנה |h*‘to buy/create’ refers to the creation of wisdom using an extension of Meaning 2. The extended nature of the meaning of this occurrence is indicated by the use of the term חִיל ‘to bring forth’ in Pro 8:24-25 to describe the same event. The interpretation/translation of Pro 8:22 has varied through the years as a result of the use of this verse in theological debates.  These theological debates may have had some affect on the early revisions of the LXX, which revised the Old Greek from ἔκτισέν ‘he created’ to |gἐκτήσατο|g* ‘he acquired’. As an extension of Meaning 2, this usage of|g |g*|hקנה |h*‘to buy/create’ in Pro 8:22 has been assigned to Meaning 3 ‘to create; to bring forth’. Because of collocational clashes inherent in the image of God giving birth, it is likely that |hקנה |h*will need to be translated as ‘to create’ rather than 'to produce; to bring forth' in many languages.  Similes will also probably need to be used in Pro 8:24-25 to communicate the similar concept of  |hחִיל |h*‘to bring forth’ that is used in Pro 8:24-25. The UBS Handbooks on Genesis, Deuteronomy, and Proverbs discuss the positive and negative factors about choosing to translate this verb as ‘to create’ versus ‘to acquire’ (Reyburn and Fry 1997: 324; Reyburn and Fry 2000; Bratcher and Hatton 2000). Because of the nature of this extended meaning, there is ultimately very little difference in the meaning. As with all extended usages of words, translators are encouraged to carefully check the reader’s understanding of the translation.
\evalev A brief examination of the translation of the phrase |hאָדָ֖ם הִקְנַ֥נִי|h* ‘a man has acquired me’ in Zec 13:5 will quickly illustrate the fact that the MT has been emended and read in a variety of ways in major English translations.  Among the translations examined for KTBH, the most frequent translation was based on the emended text |hאדמה קניני|h* ‘ground is my possession’, as may be seen in the following translations: ‘the land has been my possession’ (RSV, NRS, REB) ‘the land has been my livelihood’ (NIV), ‘the land has been my living’ (NJB), ‘I have farmed the land’ (TEV). In the CEV this phrase is apparently viewed as a parallelism that could be collapsed and hence there is no specific translation of the phrase. The NJPS has a rather unique translation that evidently reads the word |hאדם|h* ‘man’ as being connected with the root meaning ‘red’ and therefore translates it as follows: ‘I was plied with the red stuff’ (NJPS). In addition, the NEB has read the root as being from the verb |hקנא|h* ‘to be jealous’ and has translated it accordingly as ‘who has been schooled in lust’ (Smith 2002: 280). While the majority of the major English translations followed an emended text that leads to a very smooth reading, HOTTP suggests translating it as ‘a man has acquired me <as a slave>’, which follows the MT (Barthélemy, Prophetical Books II 1980: 422). The LXX translates the verb by the term |gἄνθρωπος ἐγέννησέν με|g* ‘a man has given birth to me’, which seems to indicate that the translator was reading a text similar to the MT, though he did not use the unmarked translation equivalent |gκτάομαι |g*‘to acquire’ for the translation of the verb |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’. Some translations, such as the Tok Pisin Bible, reflect an interpretation based on the MT. This translation reads as follows: Mi stap wokboi nating bilong wanpela man ‘I am the slave of one man.’ The Tok Pisin translation reinforces the preceding statement, i.e. he is just a slave and therefore he could not be a prophet.
\comp The meanings of |hקנה|h* ‘to buy’ can be divided into three groups:  1. those that refer to a literal commercial transaction (Meaning 1a-c)2. those in which 'buy' is used with an extended meaning to refer to a type of acquisition (Meanings 2a-c) 3. those that refer to the event of creation (Meaning 3), an extension of Meaning 2a. Meaning 1.

\eval Many English translations (NRSV, RSV, NJPS, REB) use the term 'buy', which properly focuses on the acquisition of the item, to translate both occurrences of |hקנה|h* in this verse. Some translations, however, use the term 'pay' (NIV, TEV, CEV) or an even more generic 'give ... a price' (NJB). While both 'pay' and 'give ... a price' are still in the Economic Domain, they focus more on the transfer of money than on the acquisition of an item, which is a major component of the meaning of |hקנה|h* 'to buy'.

If a language does not speak naturally about acquiring abstract qualities, then a better non-literal translation would be as follows: 'It's much better to spend effort on becoming wise than on getting gold and on becoming sensible than on getting silver.' (KTBH) This non-literal translation maintains the emphasis on the process that is indicated by the use of |hקנה|h* 'to buy'. CEV is an example of a non-literal translation, but it incorrectly shifts the emphasis from the acquiring of the attributes to the state of the person after the acquisition of these abstract qualities -- 'It's much better to be wise and sensible than to be rich.' In addition, CEV collapses the parallel lines, which is not an approach recommended by KTBH.

\syntagc The word |hרְכוּשׁ |h*does not appear to include human beings (Gen 14:16, 21). It does, however, sometimes include animals (Gen 36:7). At other times, |hרְכוּשׁ|h*   appears to refer to items in addition to or other than certain types of animals that are listed separately (Gen 46.6). Hence |hמִקְנֶה|h* can be in both a part-whole relationship with |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e., possessions including livestock, and it can also be the opposite of |hרְכוּשׁ|h*, i.e. livestock and NOT possessions. Some examples may be interpreted in at least two different ways. For instance, the phrase |hלִבְהֶמְתָּם וְלִרְכֻשָׁם וּלְכֹל חַיָּתָֽם׃|h*may be interpreted as referring to two coordinated items that are exclusive of each other and both of these two items are included in the all living creatures category. A second interpretation is that each of these three terms refers to distinct referents that are exclusive of the other two items. In this interpretation, the term |hחַיָּה|h* would refer to other animals that are neither cattle nor possessions, i.e., wild animals.

The wages may be given to either the person or to the owner of the hired entity (either an animate or inanimate item). 3.

\eval Several translations (NRS, NIV, RSV) maintain the same translation of |hשָׂכָר |h*for both humans and animals, i. e., 'wages'.  Wages for animals, however, are generally given to the owner of the animal. Because of this, several English translations differentiate between the two, e.g., 'men were not paid their wages and nothing was paid for the animals either' (NJB) and the NJPS above. Other translations shift to a more generic terminology that can be used for both people and animals, e.g., 'neither people nor animals were rewarded for their work' (CEV) and 'no one could afford to hire either men or animals' (TEV). If a language differentiates between wages for animals and people, translators are encouraged to follow the model in NJPS or NJB.

\keyverse A man lacking in judgment |bstrikes hands in pledge|b* and puts up security for his neighbor. (NIV)
\eval The NIV retains both the physical action and the meaning of the physical action in their translation. If the physical action of clapping hands has a different meaning in the receptor language and the inclusion of the physical act causes confusion, then it would be best to leave out the physical action and focus on the meaning of the action in the translation. A model of this approach to the translation of the idiom 'clapping of hands' can be seen in the following translations:  'to give a pledge' (NRS), 'gives a guarantee' (REB), and 'offers guarantees' (NJB). The NJPS's translation 'gives his hand' should probably not be followed because it is ambiguous as to the exact meaning of the action of giving a hand. TEV and CEV both collapse the parallelism in the verse and use a phrase to translate both terms from the Economic domain. This approach should only be used if there are no other options due to lack of vocabulary for economic activities in the receptor language.

\intro The general sense for HUQQAH is : A customary activity that is established or required by an authority. It is applied to the following contexts:1. God establishing the customary activity of natural celestial cycles which provide night and day, and seasons.2. God requiring the people of Israel to do specific customary activities, especially religious rituals3. Nations and kings establishing customary activities which are to be practiced by their people. This can include both good and bad practices, such as idolatry.
\comp The most frequent use of XUQQAH  is in Leviticus 26 x; the second most frequent is in Ezekiel 21x. Between the two they comprise almost half of the instances of XUQQAH in the Hebrew Bible.
\dfnotes Comparison with XOQ:There are some interesting distributions between XOQ and XUQQAH.The most frequent use of XUQQAH  is in Leviticus 26 x; the second most frequent is in Ezekiel 21x. Between the two they comprise almost half of the instances of XUQQAH in the Hebrew Bible.On the other hand, XOQ is most frequent in Psalms, in particular Psalms 119, and in Deuteronomy.31x in the Psalms of which 22 in Psalm 119; 21x in DeuteronomyThe distribution of morphological and grammatical element in relation with the two forms is also quite interesting:XUQQAH is most frequently found in the following constructions:   - Plural form with possessive pronominal suffixes 1st pers. sing, 3rd pers. singular, and less frequently in a noun construct - the HUQQOT of X (of a person)   - Singular - in a construct construction with the word specifying the type of XUQQAH, or identifying the person giving the HUQQAH. It very rarely occurs in singular non-suffixed form, or with other types of suffixes.XOQ on the other hand, has the following grammatical distribution:   - Plural form as an independent non-suffixed form, or with a second person singular suffix, but rarely with 3rd person sing. or 1st person sing. suffix.    - Singular form allows any type of possessive pronoun suffix, but is rarely in construct form (except with 'olam)The semantic distinction is a little less pronounced than the grammatical distribution (see XOQ entry to fill in) While XUQQAH often refers to specific laws concerning the ritual and cultic activities (sacrifices, festivals especially the passover, etc.), it can also be used in the context of both moral and cultic laws (see Leviticus 18). XOQ, on the other hand is less frequently associated with any particular law. It appears that while there is some semantic distinction between the two, there seems to be rather a choice between the two terms based on preference of morphological form and composition, perhaps for reasons of metre, and sound patterns. When examining Psalm 119, which uses almost exclusively XOQ in its plural form with the second person singular possessive pronoun suffix, it has one single instance of the use of XUQQAH in plural, with the second person singular suffix. (Psalm 119:16). There is no known reason for this, but it seems clear that it is meant to mean the same as XOQ.  There is no clear sound pattern, or semantic reason that would favor the feminine form. Perhaps there was a need for and additional syllable, to maintain the metre and rhythm of the line?In Leviticus, there is a clear distribution pattern. There are only two instances  where XOQ means |ilaw|i* : in Lev 10:11as a generic term for laws and in Lev 26:46, the very last verse of the book, which gives a concluding summary with a list of all the legal words to refer to all of the laws in Leviticus. Curiously the feminine form is not found here, though it is the term used for law throughout the book, including three verses previous in 26:43(with 1st person singular suffix). Might this concluding line be inserted at a later date?Otherwise, all other references of XOQ in Leviticus have the meaning of |ia prescribed portion|i*, and is found primarily in the singular form. On the other hand, In Deuteronomy, XOQ is not used to refer to this meaning.Deuteronomy, on the other hand, seems to governed by a morphological distribution scheme. Both the feminine and masculine forms are used to mean |ilaw|i*. XOQ is used in the plural form with no pronominal suffix except in 4 instances (out of 21), where it has the third person sing. suffix.  XUQQAH has only 8 references in Deuteronomy, and every single one of them are in the plural with a third person singular suffix. Both forms are found in the same syntactic and  semantic contexts - meaning |ilaw|i*, and used as part of a list of legal terms. Never are both terms used together in a list, as is if to indicate different types of laws.Comparing the use in the context of human laws. For XOQ, it is used generally in the singular form to mean a decree that is instituted by an authority as a law, or an established practice. One can have an unjust law (Isa 10:1). In the expression - X instituted as a XOQ.  XUQQAH in the context of humans as agents is always in plural form, with no specific individual agent, rather generally 'nations', and almost always with negative meaning : Do not follow the XUQQOT of the other nations.The suggestion that XOQ and XUQQAH differenciate meaningwise in that XOQ is |ilaw|i* and that XUQQAH is |ian established practice|i* is not always clear that it is so. For example in --- where the custom of mourning the daughter of Jepthah became a XOQ,  versus - do not follow the HUQQOT of the nations. Both can be translated as a |ipractice|i* or a |icustom.|i* See Eze 20:18 NJPS - I warned their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the practices (XUQQIM) of your fathers, do not keep their ways, and do not defile yourselves with their fetishes. And then Eze 20:19  NJPS - I the Lord am your God: Follow My laws (XUQQOT) and be careful to observe My rules.In some cases, one can perceive that HOQ can mean - an imposed decree that must be followed, while XUQQAH could mean - an established practice. (But see also MISHPAT, which can also mean custom is certain contexts.Both terms are frequently found in the collocation  with MISHPAT, and seem to have the same meaning. The distribution of use of the feminine form versus masculine form seems to be based on morphological and sound pattern combinations. Singular and Pl without pronoun suffixes - both are always in the masculine form : XOQIM and MISHPATIM. Pl with first person suffixes - XUQQOTAI ve MISHPATAI, is the general rule, though there are a few exceptions.

However, when referring to a specific law, it almost always refers to laws of ritual worship: laws concerning Passover procedures, the Sabbath, various priestly duties, and any other laws concerning the temple activities.

\intro 1. The verb |hצוה|h* is used to express any directive given by anyone in a superior, authority position to anyone under his authority as a means of imposing one's will on the other person and requiring them to do something. This meaning has various translations in English: |icommand, decree, instruct, give orders, tell someone to do something, charge.|i* It is used both in the context of rules and regulations, and laws, as well as in the context of orders for a specific one-time activity. It should never be understood as simply advice, counsel, or exhortation. Although the recipient may have the free will to reject the command, it is to the peril of his well-being, and in some cases, to his life.There are also different authority relationships for which the |hצוה|h* may be used: divine-human, kings-subjects, parent-child, master-servant, etc.  When more than one type of relationship is involved between two people, the authority role may change depending on the context. For example, in Esther, Mordecai, as uncle, |icommands|i* Esther not to reveal her origins to anyone (Est 2:20). Later, it is Esther, as queen who |iorders|i* Mordecai to observe a fast (Est 4:17). So though she does not have authority over Mordecai as niece, she does have authority over him as queen, and thus can command him.2. One extension of this basic meaning is: |ito give authority and command|i* another person to do a specific task. One specific example of this is when Moses |icommissioned |i*Joshua to take his position as leader of the Israelites as they enter Canaan. This sense is also used in the context of |igiving final instructions |i*to one's household before dying, as well as |itransmitting a message and/or commands through an intermediary|i*. 3. A second extension of the meaning is used to express God's acts of power and creation. The verb means: |ito decree an event and to make that event happen, i.e. to cause something to happen|i*. Examples of this use can be found in God |icausing |i*acts in all of his creation, the skies, the earth, the animals, and even causing people to act a certain way, especially causing enemies to destroy the Israelites. He can also |icommand|i* blessings, loyalty, His covenant, salvation, and victory.
\tnotes Depending on the language, the translation of the word |hצוה |h*may vary widely according to the context. In each case, it is important to take into consideration who is commanding whom; whether the command involves a one-time order, a binding regulation, or the investment of authority on another person; whether the recipient of the command is a willful human being or is simply an instrument in the hands of God who has no choice but to do what God says. Where the command is negative, terms such as f|iorbid,|i* may be more appropriate. See below for suggestions and examples.The words |ipermit |i*and |ipromise|i* are used by certain translations in a few limited contexts. In these cases, it seems that the context guides the interpretation more than does the basic sense of the word. The word |hצוה|h* always refers to the communication of a requirement by an authority or of the causation of an action by an authority.
\comp All five meanings of |hצוה|h* include the following five basic components: 1. An individual with authority and power over persons and objects under that authority (e.g. God, angel, kings, elder family members, any human authory figure)2. The authority wills a specific action or event be accomplished by specified agents under his authority3. The authority communicates his will to the designated agent of the action. 4. The will of the recipient of the communication is not taken into account 5. The authority powerfully imposes his will on the recipientThere is a parameter that distinguishes the first three meanings from the last two. In the first three, the agent of the action does have the choice to accept or refuse to comply to the will of the authority, but the refusal to do so will bring about serious consequences. In Meaning 5, the recipient of the command actually has no choice but to comply to the will of the authority. This sense of total obligation translates into the sense of causation, and in this context |hצוה|h* becomes a speech act; the command produces a powerful effect.  The notion of verbal communication of the command becomes figurative.  God is the only agent of these kinds of powerful speech acts. The agents of these caused actions are any and all aspects of creation both animate and inanimate (e.g. universe, rain, animals, people, abstract qualities).Meaning 4, the sense of conferring authority to another person, is somewhere in between. The person concerned may have a choice to refuse to act, but the conferring of authority is not a matter of choice on the part of the recipient. He automatically has the responsibility. It simply seems to be assumed that he will do the job.The distinctions between the first three meanings are minimal. The first provides a generic sense of the verb, while the second groups together all instances of the verb that refer to regulations and legislation. The third meaning comprises those contexts in which the word refers to one time orders. However, there are cases, where the the distinction between meanings 2 and 3 are not clear.

\syntagc The sense for this word throughout, is that of an imposing directive. It should never be understood as simply advice, counsel, or exhortation. Although the recipient may have the free will to reject the command, it is to the peril of his well-being, and in some cases to his life.  In all cases, the agent is an established authority. For example, a human cannot command God.

\eval This is a very interesting translation. Instead of literally translating the rhetorical questions and the Hebraic expression |ithe work of my hands|i*, as do almost all other translations (NJPS, NLT, NIV, CEV, REB, NRS - |iWill you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands?|i*),  GNT transforms the sentence into a very powerful exclamation, which correctly interprets the sense of the rhetorical question.

\trans In some cases there may be a specific term for legislation which is punishable, i.e. theft, murder, adultery, etc. and a different term for general commands for matters that are not punishable by humans, i.e. kindness to the poor, instruction to children, etc. There may be a tendency to want to translate the latter as |iexhortation|i* (some scholars use the term |iparanetic|i*). However, the pervading sense of an imposing directive should be retained throughout in the translation of the term.

According to Porter (1983: 125) there was "an ancient legal rule for the transfer of property, by which it was intended to indicate that Moses was given full possession of Palestine before his death."

A close study of these contexts shows that the sense of investing the authority for leadership is intended. In Numbers, God instructs Moses to commission Joshua in a public ceremony. In Deuteronomy 3, Moses reminds the people of that ceremony, and in Deuteronomy 31, it is God who directly invests the spiritual authority in a private meeting in the Tent of the Meeting, between God, Joshua, and Moses.

\intro The word MITSWAH, is a nominalisation of the verb TSIWAH. It can refer to any kind of one-time order or regulation given by an authority to those under his authority. The singular form can have several nuances of meaning: 1. the act of prescribing - eg. Listen to the MITSWAH of your father2. a body of laws - eg. The Torah and the MITSWAH3. a prescription - eg.The plural form is limited to the third meaning, and is often found in a list of terms referring to the contents of Mosaic law. The fourth meaning, is attested only once, meaning: designated portion of food for the Levites.
\tnotes It is possible that the three first meanings can be translated by one word into the receptor language. However, it is more likely that solutions such as the following may be used: 1. For meaning 1, the act of prescribing can easily be rendered with the use of the verbal form rather the nominal form, if that is more natural in the receptor language: do his MITSWAH, do what he commanded us to do. 2. For Meaning 2, a number of English translations render the sense of 'body of laws' as the plural form - 'commandments'. 3. For meaning 3, the most frequent rendering in English is simply the plural form of the nominal. It should be noted finally that some references could fit into more than one category, and some variations in English translations indicate variant interpretations as a result.
\comp While four meanings are given, the general sense is 'prescription', i.e. an action commanded and required by a person in authority to someone under him. It can be an established law, or simply an order meant for one individual or for a particular situation. These are the four meanings:1. the act of prescribing2. a collection of laws3. a prescription 4. an alloted due for the LevitesThe first two meanings use the singular form of the noun, while meaning 3 generally uses the plural form.The first meaning refers to the act of commanding, often rendered in English as : 'at the command of (the king)'.  The second meaning refers to a specific body of laws, for the most part, the Mosaic law. In each case, the noun is usually in the singular definite form. There are some cases where it is difficult to distinguish between Meaning 1 and Meaning 2 because the context is not clear. For example when the text says the מִצְוָה of the Lord, is it a reference to a specific body of laws, or to God's act of commanding? There are are also a few cases where one would have difficulty choosing between Meaning 1 and Meaning 3: Does it mean the act of commanding or an individual prescription?
\dfnotes The verbal and nominal forms of TSIWAH are very similar in meaning.  Both are found in the domain of 'prescription' or 'prescribing'. However, the verbal form seems to have a broader semantic range than the nominal form. No instances have been found meaning, the act of commissioning, or the act of commanding the universe, for example.

\syntagcc In the context of Mosaic law, this term refers to the body of commandments given by God to his people. There are numerous references where this term is collocated with TORAH (see Jos.22:5 below). The cumulative meaning of the expression, 'MITSWAH and TORAH, gives a sense of a body of rules meaning: 'the instruction for the prescriptions'.

\eval While other translations use some form of the word 'command' including the plural noun, NJPS chose the term 'Instruction' and capitalized the word.

\frame Regulation

\syntagc The use of the word for this meaning is found only once in the Hebrew Bible.  The Latin Vulgate translation suggests a text corruption of the word מְנָיוֹת , the plural form of מְנָת meaning 'share' or 'portion'. The plural form is already attested in Nehemiah 12:47 and 13:10. One reason for inclining for the emended form, is the fact that this is the only instance of this meaning. The suggestion, by ... WBC that the meaning of 'commandment' could be accepted here, is the supported by reference to Nehemiah 10:33, where the word 'commandment' is used in context of an imposed tax. However, a problem with this suggestion is that the genitive expression 'MITSWAH of ... ' is normally reserved for the agent of the the command, such as 'command' of God, or 'command' of king. In the case of this passage, the word is in genitive construction with the word 'Levite'. It would be generally understood that the Levites would not be the ones to develop such regulations. The sense of 'due' or 'portion', reflecting the meaning of  מְנָיוֹת, seems to fit better here. The translations that reflect the sense of the emended form are: NJPS, NBJ, NJB, FC. However, most of the the translations that maintain a sense of the word 'command' in their translation, inevitably have to acknowledge the sense of 'portion', as the Brenton's English translation of the Septuagint reveals: |iordered portion of the Levites|i*.

\dfnotes יעץ 'to advise, counsel, plan' and עֵצָה 'counsel, plan' have Wisdom as an Intrinsic Domain. Typically, a person senses a lack of wisdom and asks a wiser man to give advice. As is the case with other wisdom terms, the advice given or the plan formed can be for good and for evil.Under Meaning 1 we have subsumed instances of the Niphal, in the Contextual use 'to confer together with wise men in order to obtain advice'. In most dictionaries, the Niphal signals a different meaning, but in KTBH we look at the Event. The Event is that a wise man gives advice to someone who is less wise. In the cases under Meaning 1b, we see the same: X, the superior in status, but not in wisdom, allows himself to be advised by Y, the superior in wisdom, but not in status.Normally, advice is given (יעץ) by a person lower in status to a higher person, whereby the higher person, e.g. a king, can follow the advice or reject it. An exalted person does not normally give advice to his subordinates, but |icommands|i* them (צוה). When this pattern is flouted, this can be significant. Normally God has the authority to command, but in Psa 16:7, He condescends to give advice.What makes Meaning 3 ('to deliberate') different is that the participants of this event are equal. Together they are Agents, and there is no Patient.Meaning 4 seems to be related to Meaning 1 in this way, that the verb that denoted (internal) deliberation came to be used for the outcome, 'to plan' / 'to decide'. The event is different, however, because there is only one participant, the Agent.

\gram The participant roles do not correspond neatly to the grammatical roles. The grammatical subject always indicates the Agent, but the object can denote either Patient or Content. In other words: the object can denote (a) the advice, but also (b) the person to whom advice is given; (c) both can be combined. Examples:(a) In Exo 18:19 Jethro says to Moses |hאִיעָצְךָ|h* 'I will counsel you'. Moses is the Patient.(b) In 2Sa 16:23 we read about the advice (|hעֵצָה|h*) that Ahithophel used to give (|hיעץ|h*). The advice is the Content.(c) In 1Ki 1:12 the prophet Nathan says to Bathsheba: 'Let me counsel you a counsel'. Bathsheba is the Patient, the counsel is the Content.In some cases there is a third party who will be the victim of the advice (in KTBH terms he is still called 'Benefactive'). This Benefactive is indicated by a preposition (|hעַל|h* 'against'). E.g. 2Sa 17:21 'Ahithophel has adviced such and such against you'.

\keyverse NIV84 - Listen now to me and I |bwill give you |b*some|b advice|b*, and may God be with you.
\eval The rendering of this Meaning does not seem to be problematic. Most translations have 'to give advice', which is a good rendering, but also 'to counsel'. When the Hebrew text has יעץ עֵצָה ('to advise an advice'), as in e.g. 1Ki 12:8, it should be rendered as is natural in the target language.
\trans The rendering of Qal participle יֹעֵץ does not seem to present problems in English versions. 'Advisor' or 'counseller' are adequate renderings. In some contexts, e.g. 2Sa 15:12, some languages would need to make clear that Ahitophel was not a priest or a soothsayer, but a political counsellor to the king.

\eval The Contextual Domains for this Use require different translations for each context. (But perhaps some languages can do with one rendering.)

Therefore English versions differ ('to confer together', 'to take counsel together', 'to talk things over', 'to discuss things'). The main issue in Hebrew is that Sanballat makes it sound as if he and Nehemiah are equals, and various versions (such as NIV, for example) render this adequately.

\not (b) At first sight, Meaning 2 ('to deliver an oracle that predicts the future') does not seem to be related to the core meaning 'to advise', and therefore Num 24:14 has long puzzled scholars. There are three possible ways of dealing with this exceptional case.1) The verb יעץ is retained in its normal meaning 'to advise'. This is how the great medieval commentator Rashi explains the passage. He connects the passage to Num 31:16, where it is told that Balaam advised to seduce the Israelites to idolatry through the combination with sex. Rashi thinks that episode is hinted at here, but implicitly. He interprets Num 24:14 as follows: 'I will go to my people, but first I will give you an advice [i.e. to seduce the Israelites], because otherwise they will become dangerous to your people.' 2) The |iTheologisches Woerterbuch zum AT|i*, III, 721 suggests that people who went to consult an oracle, did so to obtain advice (sometimes also called oracle).  What the oracle answered in response to the question, a revelation of the divine plan, was therefore also called 'advice'. The verb  יעץ thus denotes the utterance of an oracle.3) REB, CEV and NIV translate differently: 'let me warn you'. The reasoning behind that seems to be that the verb normally means 'to counsel', but what follows in vss 15ff. is not an advice. Balaam rather |iannounces|i* what will happen. These three versions interpret the announcement as a warning to Balak, in order to be close to the normal meaning 'to advise, to counsel'.The second interpretation has been followed here, but option 3 is also possible. Option 1 is not followed by modern Jewish or Christian versions.

\intro The verb |hבין|h* is used to denote various degrees of mental activity with respect to something, from 'noticing' and 'observing carefully' to 'understanding'. Since in the Hebrew worldview personal characteristics are never sharply separated from the actions that result from them, the same verb can also mean 'to be understanding, prudent' and 'to act with understanding'.
\hebraist According to the grammars of Gesenius-Kautzsch-Cowley (73a) and Joüon-Muraoka (54f; 81d), the usual and old form is |hהבין|h* ; hence the imperfect |hיבין|h* is a Hiphil. The forms that morphologically can only be Qal forms are probably secondary hypercorrections, since its Hiphil had acquired a causative meaning, which it originally did not have.
\altint Some recent dictionaries, e.g. NIDOTTE, present |hבין|h* as quite a straightforward entry. Although the rendering of this verb is not so complicated as that of other verbs, it has more contextual uses than is sometimes realized.

\dfnotes The overall frame for this verb is discernment and wisdom. Since discernment can be applied to a wide number of activities and professional occupations, it is no wonder that the frame is activated in a wide area of domains. What they have in common, though, is their positive stand in the Israelite mindset. The verb |hבין|h* is never used in domains that are negatively valued, such as criminal activities.

\not (a) Several interpretations of this difficult verse are possible. When MT is maintained, it might be interpreted with NIV as 'Before your pots can feel (i.e. notice, in a metaphorical sense) the heat of the thorns...' Other interpretations of MT can be found in HOTTP.

In that case there is no occurrence of |hבין|h*. But the Qere (Masoretic reading proposal) results in 'the upright man discerns his course (NJPS). In principle the translator is free to choose between Ketiv and Qere, but we recommend to follow the Ketiv here (with HOTTP).

\eval Neither 'understanding' nor 'wisdom' (all English versions) seem to be the right term here. In fact the same word for 'technical insight' is used as for human craftsmen, but then metaphorically applied to YHWH as the divine craftsman. Therefore the rendering to be chosen should not be too far removed from notions of craftsmanship. The word that would come to mind for English speakers is 'creativity', but we should keep in mind that innovative designing is typical of modern Western art. In Antiquity generally, expertise in a craft consisted primarily of mastering what the master had handed down. Creativity was present, but it was not considered the hallmark of true art, as it is in the modern world.

\not (a) The translation of |hתְּבוּנָה|h* in this difficult verse depends on whether and how the participant change is being resolved. The translator has to choose between two possibibilities:   * if the final clause is changed from 3rd person to 2nd person (as in NIV and CEV), it refers to the unintelligent preparation for battle by the Edomites addressed;   * if the 3rd person is maintained (as in NJPS), the clause refers to the enemies' seemingly irrational behaviour.We recommend to choose the first option. Participant changes from 3rd to 2nd and vice versa are a characteristic feature of prophetic texts and appararently did not generate the same confusion it does to the majority of our readerships.

\intro According to Fox, |hבִּינָה |h*'designates the faculty of intellectual discernment and interpretation, the exercise of that faculty, and the product thereof, in words or deeds. (...) The raw faculty of |hבִּינָה|h* (...) is similar to the modern concept of intelligence, except for the modern assumption that intelligence is innate.' In Biblical thought, |hבִּינָה|h* can be acquired or God-given.

\dfnotes Both |hתְּבוּנָה|h* and |hבִּינָה|h* are derived from |hבין|h*. But it seems that the former occurs in more specialized meanings, whereas the latter comes close to what we would call 'common sense'. That not only men, but also animals are sometimes credited with |hבִּינָה|h* indicates its earthly essence. It is never used for God.That several occurrences in Proverbs belong to the first contextual meaning becomes clear when reading Pro.1:4-6, where it is said that the wisdom and the insight taught here will make the wise even wiser. Wisdom makes the difference between the 'simpletons' (of whom there are apparently too many) and the wise.When occurring together, |hחָכְמָה|h* precedes |hבִּינָה|h*. This indicates that the latter is the more specific of the two.|hבִּינָה |h*can be the object of verbs like |hבקשׁ|h* and |hקנה|h*, which means that insight can be acquired or learned. In wisdom literature, the 'son' is encouraged to seek insight actively. At the same time it may be considered a gift of God, through the collocation with |hנתן|h*.

\addinfo 1. The root |hישׁר|h* has one literal sense and two metaphorical extensions, though they are not all attested for every term related to the root. The literal sense is less common than the extensions, but it is sufficiently well-attested to establish it as the basis for the extensions. All three senses are have parallels in other languages of the ANE.The literal sense refers to something that is straight, if it is one-dimensional, or level, if it is two-dimensional. English lexicalises this distinction between straight and level, but Hebrew does not.The first metaphorical extension maps the Physical shape Frame on to the Successfulness Frame. If a journey is literally |hישׁר|h*, then it is free from detours and diversions. Similarly, if it is metaphorically |hישׁר|h*, then it is free from detours, dangers and other problems. If land is literally |hישׁר|h*, then it is free from hills, bumps and other obstacles. Similarly, if it is metaphorically |hישׁר|h*, then it is free from difficulties and from obstacles that might cause stumbling. In either case, the metaphor implies that the venture in view will be successful and safe.The second metaphorical extension maps the Physical shape Frame on to the Moral uprightness Frame. This is similar to the English metaphor ‘uprightness’ in that it is Physical shape that is the metaphorical source. However, in English, it is specifically verticality that is the source whereas in Hebrew it is straight/level. The mapping seems to be that, as a journey or land that is |hישׁר |h*is free from physical or topographical irregularities, so a life that is |hישׁר |h*is free from moral irregularities.The two metaphors are linked not only in the derivation but also that, especially in Proverbs, the morally upright life will be a successful life.Another sense of |hישׁר |h*appears to be a further extension of the second metaphor in which the moral nuance is absent and all that is left is the personal preference of the one who evaluates the person or conduct.The verb has, in addition, various causative and declarative senses, all of which are closely related to the senses described above.2. |hלֵב|h* or |hלֵבָב|h* collocate with the root |hישׁר|h* as attribute, in a construct pair, subject-predicate or other way, 13 times and with the root |hתמם|h* 6 times. By contrast, the |hצדק|h* root is never used as an attribute of |hלֵב|h* or |hלֵבָב|h*. This suggests that |hישׁר|h* or |hתמם|h* may be used of an inward disposition, whereas |hצדק|h* is not. The latter refers primarily to outward behaviour and collocates with verbs or verbal nouns of doing 35 times. That is not to say that |hישׁר|h* and |hתמם|h* are never used of outward behaviour, since both are used as attributes of |hדֶּרֶךְ|h*,16 and 11 times respectively. (Data from Even Shoshan).

Both make sense in the context, but 'esteem right, approve' is closer in meaning to other uses of the term and so should be preferred.2. LXX and Vul appear to have read the |hכ|h* of the second |hכל|h* as a suffix attached to the preceding word, 'your precepts' as elsewhere in Psa 119. Most modern translations accept this emendation. HOTTP, however, recommends retention of MT and remarks that the second |hכל|h* 'refers to all the precepts in their totality or in every domain whatsoever, without exception'.

By omitting the phrase 'in my eyes/sight' CEV 'what is right' loses the explicit assertion that it is God who is evaluating the actions.

\eval Most translations use 'upright' (NIV, RSV, NRS, NJPS, REB) and this should be followed. TEV and CEV use 'good' but that is too generic unless the context evokes moral good, so this is not an ideal model to follow. NJB uses 'honest' which, in English, restricts the meaning to words or money, whereas the Hebrew is not so restrictive.

\syntagcc Both instances of this Use are in the phrase |hסֵפֶר הַיָּשָׁר|h* 'the Book of Jashar/the Upright' apparently referring to a book containing accounts of Israelite heroes. Authorities differ over whether |hיָשָׁר|h* should be treated as proper name 'Jashar', presumably referring to the author, or as a common noun 'the Upright', presumably referring to the content. Most modern translations favour the former, but the presence of the article is evidence against it.

\eval The Hebrew equivalent 'upright [things] will be with him and he will do [them]' is so ambiguous that there are several possible interpretations. There is also a significant textual problem to consider. If the traditional Hebrew text is retained, then NEB to mean 'he will come to fair terms with him' is a good model to follow.

It should be made clear that the author disapproves of this state of affairs because he saw no attempt to maintain uprightness; individuals did what they chose without regard to God or a king. Thus, CEV, ‘whatever they thought was right’ should not be followed, since it suggests that the Israelites were aiming at some external standard of uprightness.

For discussion, see the note in NET. BHS recommends deletion as a dittograph for |hמֵישָׁרִים|h*, since there is no equivalent of |hיָשָׁר|h* in LXX.

\not (a) Probable. In the context of v 11 alone, |hיֹשֶׁר|h* could refer either to moral uprightness or to successfulness.

\intro ·	The term has one main literal sense and one extension·	The extended sense is rare for the verb but much more common for related terms which are rarely used in the literal sense·	The literal sense conveys ‘completeness’, in that some event, attribute or thing is complete or finished·	Corresponding to this literal sense, there is a causative, where someone causes something to be complete or to cease·	The other sense extends ‘completeness’ to ‘morally blameless’·	This sense is applied both to people and to God

\addinfo Three distinct Meanings have been identified for the root |hתמם|h*:	1 to be complete, finished, lacking nothing	2 to be morally blameless	3 to be without defectThe first is the most literal Meaning and the second is derived from it by extension to the Morality Frame, in the sense of moral completeness. The English term ‘wholehearted’ conveys the sense of completeness, but lacks the moral direction implicit in |hתמם|h*, since it is possible to be wholehearted in pursuit of evil. English translations have traditionally render the root by terms related to ‘blameless’ when they need an adjective or ‘integrity’ when they need a noun.The third Meaning is a technical term only used to describe animals acceptable for sacrifice and only attested for the adjective |hתָּמִים|h*. It may derive by extension directly from the sense 'complete', or it may derive from the Meaning ‘blameless’, either transferred from people who offer the sacrificial animals to the animals or from God to animals that are acceptable to him.|hלֵב|h* or |hלֵבָב|h* collocate with the root |hישׁר|h* as attribute, in a construct pair, subject-predicate or other way, 13 times and with the root |hתמם|h* 6 times. By contrast, the |hצדק|h* root is never used as an attribute of |hלֵב|h* or |hלֵבָב|h*. This suggests that |hישׁר|h* or |hתמם|h* may be used of an inward disposition, whereas |hצדק|h* is not. The latter refers primarily to outward behaviour and collocates with verbs or verbal nouns of doing 35 times. That is not to say that |hישׁר|h* and |hתמם|h* are never used of outward behaviour, since both are also used as attributes of |hדֶּרֶךְ|h*, 16 and 11 times respectively. (Data from Even Shoshan).

Most English translations do this by rendering |hתמם|h* as 'finished' or 'completed' and expressing the verbal action as a non-finite verb. Other languages may use an adverb equivalent to 'completely' modifying the verbal action expressed as a finite verb.

The nuance to convey is that Judah's unclean acts will cease. Ezekiel deals elsewhere with what happens after that.

\eval Most versions use an expression based on 'blameless'. This is a good model.

\not (a) Most modern versions, except NIV, appear to read an emended text |hתָמּוּ|h* for |hתָמְנוּ|h*, supported by Syr and Tg, with 'Yahweh's loyalty' as subject. This makes for excellent parallelism, but the first |hכִּי|h* in the verse is awkward. MT is not only intelligible, but has, itself, a forceful contrast, 'we have not come to an end (|hתמם|h*) because his compassion has not come to an end (|hכלה|h*)'. HOTTP recommends reading MT.

\not (c) The construction here is asyndetic verbal hendiadys. Both the main verb, כרת, and תמם have the same finite form (cf GKC 120.g, h; Jouon and Muraoka 177.g). The semantic contribution of תמם is still the same; it expresses the completeness of the action.

\not (e) 1. LXX appears to have read |hובדן|h* for |hוכן|h*. See the extended discussion of HOTTP, which ultimately recommends translation of MT as it stands.2. MT is cryptic as it stands but is intelligible if a very general verbal action is supplied, 'they ceased [doing what they would have done]'. Most translations supply an English idiom to express the whole idea; the best among them is NJPS, 'and that was the end of the matter'.

\notxx (f) NOTE
\not (g) This verb in the Qal is used transitively only here and in Jer 27:8 and emendation has been proposed for both. See HOTTP for details; their conclusion is that MT should be retained. The simplest emendation is found in the text of many Hebrew mss, which read |hט|h* for |hת|h*, 'they have concealed [a plot]'. If MT is retained, the meaning must be something like 'we have completed a well-plotted plot' (cf NIV, RSV, NRS, TEV, CEV).

\notpt (g) NOTE
\notxx (g) NOTE
\not (h) This verb in the Qal is used transitively only here and in Psa 64:7 and emendation has been proposed for both. Since Jeremiah makes much use of the phrase |hנתן בְיָד|h*, many read |hתתן|h* here, with the support of Syr and Targum (cf NICOT). MT is the harder reading and if it is retained, then the verb has an Agent as subject and Patient as object, more characteristic of the Hiphil of |hתמם|h*.
\notfr (h) NOTE
\notsp (h) NOTE
\notpt (h) NOTE
\notxx (h) NOTE
\not (i) The ancient versions appear to have read the vowels for the noun 'transgressions' rather than the participle 'transgressors'. This would leave the verb either without an object 'transgressions were complete', for which onr would expect the Qal of |hתמם|h*, or with only a vague subject, 'someone completed transgressions', which would have no reasonable candidate for the subject. It seems better to retain MT and understand the Hiphil as inwardly transitive (cf IBHS 27.2.f), 'when transgressors have completed [their transgressions]'.
\notfr (i) NOTE
\notsp (i) NOTE
\notpt (i) NOTE
\notxx (i) NOTE
\not (j) The Q has much better support than the K in the ancient versions and is more widely accepted among modern interpreters, though see KD and note NJB. The K probably represents confusion with the fifth in the sequence of infinitives construct. Reading the Q, the meaning must be either 'to put an end to sin' as in the previous clause (cf NIV, RSV, NRS, REB) or 'to make sin complete', so that it reaches full measure (cf NJPS).

\not (l) The Hithpael (2Sa 22:26 = Psa 18:26) is often translated 'you show yourself blameless' but this is not required by the context which only demands 'you are blameless' or 'you deal blamelessly'.

Look for a term that expresses thorough-going moral uprightness, but does not have connotations of absolute perfection. In general, when translators need a noun to render the |hתמם|h* root, they often use 'integrity' and when they need an adjective they often use 'blameless'. This approach may be followed.

Lev 22:17-25 provides the only full definition of the term (though see Num 19:2) and should form the basis for translation. Its relationship to the other Meanings is not clear. It may derive by extension directly from the sense 'complete', established for the root. Alternatively, it may derive from the moral Meaning either transferred from people who offer the sacrificial animals to the animals or from God to animals that are acceptable to him.

\altint Scholarly debate about the |hצדק |h*word group has centred around two issues relevant to KTBH.1. There have been two main approaches to the basic meaning of the word group. Some see a reference to ‘accordance with a norm’ while others understand it to refer to ‘fidelity to a relationship’ (Seifrid 2001, 416). Many instances of the terms could be subsumed under the latter understanding, especially those where God rescues Israel from their enemies. However, contra von Rad (OTT 1.377), there is a significant number of instances where God is said to be |hצַדִּיק |h*when he acts with punitive justice against unfaithful Israel (eg Dan 9:7, 14, 16; Neh 9:33; 2Ch 12:1-6), which do not fit well with ‘fidelity to a relationship’. It thus seems better to take the |hצדק |h*word group to refer to ‘in accordance with a norm’. The most concrete use of the terms, where weights and measures are to have the attribute |hצֶדֶק |h*(Lev 19:36; Deu 25:15; Ezk 45:10), fits well into this understanding. 2. This raises the second issue in scholarly debate, because the relevant norm is very rarely explicit in the immediate context, and it has to be recovered from a wider context. Some take the Covenant as the norm against which righteousness is evaluated (eg TDOT, TWOT). This provides a framework which accommodates most instances of the |hצדק |h*word group, though not all. Nonetheless it provides a helpful starting point.·	When Israel is faithful, they are acting in accord with the covenant stipulations and they are righteous.·	When God blesses faithful Israel, he is acting in accord with the covenant blessings and he is righteous.·	When God punishes unfaithful Israel, he is acting in accord with the covenant curses and he is still righteous.·	Even when God restores repentant Israel, he is acting in accord with the covenant and he is righteous.In fact, if covenant is the norm by which behaviour is assessed, the relational and norm-based understandings are very close, in that a covenant is essentially relational, but includes terms to which both parties are expected to adhere.	Seifrid, however, notes that the |hצדק |h*root rarely collocates with |hבְּרִית |h*and expresses surprise at this, since ‘both |hבְּרִית |h*and the |hצדק |h*word group have fields of meaning having to do with relationships, and both have ethical and juridical dimensions’. He concludes that covenant is not the relevant norm for most instances of the |hצדק |h*word group, but rather the context is creation and |hצדק |h*should be seen as ‘order’ (2001, 423).	Against Seifrid, however, other terms which do have strong covenantal overtones such as the אמן root and more significantly |hתֹּורָה |h*and  |hחֶסֶד|h*, and also the formula |hוְהָיוּ־לִי לְעָם וַאֲנִי אֶהְיֶה לָהֶם לֵאלֹהִים|h* ‘they will be my people and I will be their God’ in Zec 8:8 do collocate with the |hצדק |h*root. Furthermore, where the |hצדק |h*root and |hבְּרִית |h*do collocate, the logical link between them is strong. For example, Neh 9:8, ... |hוְכָרֹות עִמֹּו הַבְּרִית לָתֵת אֶת־אֶרֶץ הַכְּנַעֲנִי ... לָתֵת לְזַרְעֹו וַתָּקֶם אֶת־דְּבָרֶיךָ כִּי צַדִּיק אָתָּה׃|h* ‘…you made the covenant with him to give him the land of the Canaanites …, to give it to his descendants, and you fulfilled your words for you are righteous’. Similarly, in Dan 9:4 God keeps the covenant, but in vv 5-6 Israel does not. Then, in v 7, God is righteous, but Israel is in trouble. The analysis in KTBH thus takes Covenant as the relevant norm, and thus a contextual Domain for both divine and human behaviour wherever it seems appropriate.	As noted above, for the small number of instances of the root in Genesis, the norm can be seen more generally as societal norms. After Sinai, the terms of the covenant were expected to replace or supplement those societal norms. The other group of instances not linked to the covenant domain is where the root occurs in the Wisdom literature where the covenant is generally considered not to be a prominent feature.	This departs from Seifrid’s understanding less than might be thought. He takes the wider view of righteousness as a creational concept, but recognises that many instances of the |hצדק |h*word group occur in covenant contexts, whereas KTBH sees the covenant context as more fundamental to the Hebrew world-view but recognises that occasionally the Biblical writers use the terms in a wider context.
\qumran TLOT notes that 'the OT correlation-God conveys |hצֶדֶק|h* only on the one who is |hצַדִּיק|h*-has dissolved. The divine |hצְדָקָה|h* is associated with the forgiveness of sins: "Through his |hצְדָקֹות|h* my sins are wiped out" (1QS 11:3, 12-14; cf. 10:11). Such statements stand on the threshold between the OT and the NT and are already reminiscent of the Pauline discussion of the |gδικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ|g*.'
\nt A separation between righteous behaviour and status before God as a righteous person (contrast Frame and Domain Notes) surfaces in Romans, most explicitly in 4:4 '... God who justifies the wicked' (NIV). In the flow of Paul's logic, since 'there is no-one righteous, not even one' (3:10), no-one could have righteous status before God in any other way.

\dfnotes Two elements seem to be in the righteousness frame that is activated by most uses of the root: righteous behaviour and status as a righteous person in the eyes of a community. Sometimes the status aspect of the frame is clearly in focus and these instances of the terms are distinguished. More often, however, either behaviour is in focus, or there is no clear focus, and these are grouped together.In Protestant theology, and arguably in the NT, a distinction is made between righteous status and righteous behaviour. This distinction is found even in discussion of the OT, but it is probably too modern and too western and owes more to the Reformation debates than to the Hebrew usage (cf Seifrid 2001, 422). One whose behaviour is righteous should be accorded righteous status eg |hוְהִצְדִּיקוּ אֶת־הַצַּדִּיק וְהִרְשִׁיעוּ אֶת־הָרָשָׁע|h* ‘they will declare righteous the righteous and they will declare wicked the wicked’ (Deu 25:1). Any reversal of that is prohibited eg |hמַצְדִּיק רָשָׁע וּמַרְשִׁיעַ צַדִּיק תֹּועֲבַת יְהוָה גַּם־שְׁנֵיהֶם |h*‘one who declares righteous the wicked and one who declares wicked the righteous are both an abomination to Yahweh’ (Pro 17:15). In cognitive terms, declaring the righteous wicked, or the converse, is an example of frame-breaking, because it runs counter to the expectations raised by the frame that is evoked. The concepts ‘behaviour’ and ‘status’ are distinguishable in the Hebrew mind-set, but not separable. Thus KTBH distinguishes between righteous status and righteous behaviour only to the extent that one or other is in focus in a particular context.	There are rare exceptions where people have a righteous status before God in spite of their unrighteous behaviour eg Isa 53:11, where the |hצדק|h* root is explicit, and also Psalm 51, where the root it is not used but the same idea is present.|hלֵב|h* or |hלֵבָב |h*collocate with the root |hישׁר |h*as attribute, in a construct pair, subject-predicate or other way, 13 times and with the root |hתמם|h* 6 times. By contrast, the |hצדק |h*root is never used as an attribute of |hלֵב |h*or |hלֵבָב|h*. This suggests that |hישׁר |h*or |hתמם |h*may be used of an inward disposition, whereas |hצדק |h*is not. The latter refers primarily to outward behaviour and collocates with verbs or verbal nouns of doing 35 times. That is not to say that |hישׁר |h*and |hתמם |h*are never used of outward behaviour, since both are used as attributes of |hדֶּרֶךְ|h* (16 and 11 times respectively; data from Even Shoshan).

The same is true of those translations that render by 'justify' (NIV, NJB, REB) and either may be followed.

\not (d) The focus and the precise nuance of the Hiphil to be understood here is closely linked to the identity of the Isaiah's servant figure. A human Servant at about the time of the exile could do no more than vindicate or save 'the many'. This thinking may lie behind the view of TDOT that this means 'deliver, help' as in Psa 82:3 and Isa 50:8 (cf BDB 'justify, vindicate the cause of, save' and HALOT 'to assist someone towards his rights'). However, the difficulty of identifying a suitable human referent suggests to others that Isaiah's Servant figure is Messianic prophecy in the traditional sense.

\not (a) Some of the LXX tradition, followed by RSV but not NRS, adds 'the Lord' or 'the Lord God' as the subject of the second colon, but MT lacks any divine name and can be understood to have 'gracious, compassionate and righteous' in apposition to 'upright', in spite of the mismatch of number. KD insists that, even without a divine name, it is God himself who is the |hאוֹר|h* which rises in the darkness and the three adjectives 'gracious, compassionate and righteous' modify |hאוֹר|h*. Given the word order, this seems unlikely.
\notfr (a) NOTE
\notsp (a) NOTE
\notpt (a) NOTE
\notxx (a) NOTE
\not (b) NJPS, '... Or captives retrieved from a victor?' attempts to follow MT, which is supported by the Targum and probably LXX, and make sense of |hצַדִּיק|h* in this context, but 'victor' would be a unique Use of |hצַדִּיק |h*and stretches its meaning too far. 1QIs|ua|u*, supported by Syr and Vul, reads |hעָרִיץ |h*'fierce warrior', as in v 25, and most translations other than NJPS have followed this reading. NICOT notes the tendency of 1QIs|ua|u* to smooth out difficult readings, but accepts the emendation, as does HOTTP, with degree of probability C. If MT is retained, perhaps the translation of KD might be the best '... or will the captive host of the righteous escape?', though, as noted by Young, this destroys the parallelism.
\notfr (b) NOTE
\notsp (b) NOTE

\not (c) This is difficult in that both the identity of the singers and the identity of 'the righteous' are uncertain. The majority view seems to be that the righteous one is Yahweh, as the context seems to require, since in the two previous verses it is Yahweh whose praise has been sung in vv 14-15. NICOT notes the points made to the contrary by KD, but regards the context as conclusive. As for the singers, WBC notes 'Who are these who shout encouragement to Yahweh from the outer edges of the land which forms this stage of action? Are they the Israelites who have been exiled to far places? Are they members of Yahweh’s heavenly court? Are they admirers from among the nations? They remain unidentified. It is sufficient to note that Yahweh’s work is known and appreciated.'
\notfr (c) NOTE
\notsp (c) NOTE
\notpt (c) NOTE
\notxx (c) NOTE
\not (d) KTBH follows most modern translations (except RSV) in assuming a reference to God as the righteous one. 'Although |hצַדִּיק|h* elsewhere in this book always refers to a human being, here it refers to God because it is in apposition to "the one who casts down the wicked," who can only be the LORD' (NICOT). For further arguments supporting this assignment, see KD.

\not (f) In the mouth of Pharaoh, this is not a confession of faith, but an acknowledgement that in the current confrontation it is Yahweh who is in the right and Pharaoh and his people who are in the wrong. Note the articles on |hהַצַּדִּיק|h* and |hהָרְשָׁעִֽים|h* (see jm 137.l and NIDOTTE 3.752). Yahweh has acted in accordance with what he said (v 18).

\notxx (f) NOTE
\not (g) This appears to be unique, being the only instance of the term not referring to God or a human (cf TDOT, NIDOTTE), though note the similar concepts in Psa 119, where the noun |hצֶדֶק|h* is used as an attribute of God's statutes.
\notfr (g) NOTE

\notpt (g) NOTE
\notxx (g) NOTE
\not (h) On the basis of Phoenician inscriptions and Ugaritic texts, the theological dictionaries (TDOT, TLOT, NIDOTTE) and more recent commentaries (WBC, NICOT) argue for 'legitimate descendant' here and in 33:15. However, even the more recent translations do not follow them.
\notfr (h) NOTE
\notsp (h) NOTE
\notpt (h) NOTE
\notxx (h) NOTE
\not (i) The commentaries (WBC, TOTC, KD) understand a reference to a king who will exercise justice, whereas most of the translations render it by 'triumphant' or 'victorious' or the like. However, the latter stretches the meaning too far and it is not necessary to assume that it has the same meaning as the participle that follows, so KTBH follows the commentaries.

\intro ·	The term always has connotations of conformity to a norm·	This is particularly clear in those cases where the term is used to describe weights and measures that match the standard.·	In various other contexts, that norm is the covenant, wisdom principles or, more rarely, societal norms·	Most often, it describes general human behaviour according to a norm·	A person’s status in the eyes of a community may be distinguished from that person’s behaviour, but they are never separated. People have righteous status because their behaviour is righteous.·	It is used of human rulers and judges when they fulfil their duty according to the appropriate norm·	It is used of God when he acts in accordance with the covenant, either in giving well-being to faithful Israel or punishing unfaithful Israel.·	It is used of sacrifices that are in accordance with the norm of the law

\syntagcc The commentaries (WBC, NICOT, TOTC, KD) and translations indicate three possible interpretations of the phrase |hזִבְחֵי־צֶדֶק|h*, though there is no need to assume that all three instances of the phrase have the same meaning:1. Sacrifices offered according to the law.2. Sacrifices offered by those who were more generally faithful to the law.3. Sacrifices offered in response to God's righteous acts towards his people.The commentaries are divided but, for the most part, give no reasons for their decisions.

\not (b) Verse 20 would suggest the genitive is 'the gates for the righteous',  through which they enter. 'Those entering in must be "righteous ones;" only conformity with the divine loving will gives the right to enter' (KD, cf TLOT).

\not (c) The context seems to demand a reference to Israel's righteous behaviour. However, the parallel expression is 'the glory of Yahweh'. NICOT notes that 'the two ideas are combined. It is as the Lord empowers the people in his gracious righteousness that they will be enabled to live righteous and holy lives in his presence.' Nonetheless, the focus seems to be on Israel's righteous behaviour.

\not (d) The Masoretic accents indicate that the phrase |hנְוֵה־צֶדֶק|h* is in apposition to |hיהוה|h* (cf WBC), and the same phrase is used in 50:7 to refer to Yahweh himself. However, none of the standard translations takes it this way. Rather, |hנְוֵה־צֶדֶק|h* and הַר הַקֹּדֶשׁ are taken in apposition to one another as a vocative, referring to Zion. In this case, the meaning of the phrase is 'the place where people live righteously'.
\notfr (d) NOTE
\notsp (d) NOTE
\notpt (d) NOTE
\notxx (d) NOTE
\not (e) Most translations render |hצֶדֶק|h* by 'just cause' or the like, but the psalmist is clearly confident of the righteousness of his behaviour, so it must be his status as a righteous person that is in question. WBC notes that '|hצֶדֶק|h* causes problems, though the parallelism implies that it must mean something like "(plea for) vindication, righteousness."' Similarly TOTC, '[the psalmist] searches his heart and finds assurance that his piety is not pretence ... he therefore appeals to God to adjudicate accordingly, for his name needs to be cleared'.

\not (f) The use of |hשׁלם|h* 'to restore, replace' (HALOT) and the promise of increase in the next verse seem to require a focus on the well-being that would result from the righteous behaviour to which Bildad is urging Job. Compare NICOT, 'your righteous estate .... means that the extensive holdings of Job bore witness to the righteousness of their sheikh', though WBC disagrees, 'the righteousness of Job is regarded poetically as inhabiting his "estate"' and translates 'the abode of your righteousness.'

\notpt (f) NOTE
\notxx (f) NOTE
\not (g) The suffix refers to the psalmist, but the |hצֶדֶק|h* appears to be salvation wrought by Yahweh. In v 27b, the psalmist's friends respond with praise to Yahweh, and in v 28 the psalmist's own response is to speak of Yahweh's |hצֶדֶק|h*. In other words, the suffix is not subjective, but expresses the beneficiary.

\not (i) Oaks, planted by Yahweh that display his splendour, his faithfulness to his covenant. That is not to imply that the people do not behave righteously, but that the focus is on their restoration.

\notpt (j) NOTE
\notxx (j) NOTE
\not (k) The phrase |hנְוֵה־צֶדֶק|h* (cf Job 8:6; Jer 31:23) is in apposition to Yahweh and |hנָוֶה|h* continues the imagery of the flock and |hרֵבֶץ|h* 'resting-place' in v 6. This much is clear. Many translations render the phrase by 'their true pasture' of the like, but, though this makes good sense in the context, to stretch the meaning of |hצֶדֶק|h* so that it comes to mean 'true' as opposed to 'false' goes too far. The assignment follows KD, 'the One in whom is contained that righteousness which is the source of Israel's salvation'.
\notfr (k) NOTE
\notsp (k) NOTE
\notpt (k) NOTE
\notxx (k) NOTE
\not (l) It is possible that this refers to God's original intention, when he gave |hתּוֹרָה|h* to Israel, to fulfil the covenant blessings, but v 20 refers to Israel's blindness and v 22 to the covenant curses which Yahweh has brought on Israel. The context thus seems to point to Yahweh's righteousness as his fulfilling of the covenant curses on unfaithful Israel.
\notfr (l) NOTE
\notsp (l) NOTE
\notpt (l) NOTE
\notxx (l) NOTE
\not (m) Although the covenant is not prominent in the wisdom literature, God's activities in vv 5-7 do correspond well to his acts of covenant righteousness.

\intro ·	The term always has connotations of conformity to a norm·	In various contexts, that norm is the covenant, wisdom principles or, more rarely, societal norms·	Most often, it describes general human behaviour according to a norm·	A person’s status in the eyes of a community may be distinguished from that person’s behaviour, but they are never separated. People have righteous status because their behaviour is righteous.·	In a few cases the term is used for the well-being that was believed to result from righteous behaviour·	It is used of human rulers and judges when they fulfil their duty according to the appropriate norm·	It is used of God when he acts in accordance with the covenant, either in giving well-being to faithful Israel or punishing unfaithful Israel.·	In two case it is used for a legal right or claim, an extension of the use for rulers and judges when they fulfil their duty

\not (a) This assignment understands the 3fs suffix on |hחשׁב |h*to refer to a preceding verbal idea (GKC 135.p), in this case, Abram's faith, and follows NIDOTTE in seeing this faith counted as a righteous act.

\not (f) Commentators are divided over whether מַגִּישֵׁי מִנְחָה בִּצְדָקָה refers to those who would offer sacrifices according to the law, in contrast to those being offered in Malachi's time, or sacrifices offered by those who were faithful to the law. In an eschatological context, the purification by the refiner will be radical and the Levites will have a thoroughgoing righteousness. As a result, of course, the sacrifices they offer will be as prescribed by the law, but the primary reference of |hצְדָקָה|h* is to that of the offerers, not their offerings.

\not (g) There are three possibilities distinguished by the way the Hiphil of |hשׁוב|h* is understood.1. 'He [God] restores to a person his righteous status' (cf NIV).2. 'He [the man] recounts to [other] people his salvation' (cf RSV).3. 'He [God] repays him for his righteous behaviour' (cf NRS).The third option seems unlikely in view of the confession of unrighteousness in v 27-28. The second is sometimes based on emendation of |hוישׁב |h*to |hויבשׂר|h*, but the Hiphil of |hשׁוב|h*, even without a speech word can have the sense 'bring back word, report' (BDB 999b) and this would fit well with the |hתְּרוּעָה|h* in the preceding colon. However, this would require the |hאֱנוֹשׁ|h* to refer not to the restored sinner but collectively to people not otherwise mentioned; this seems unnatural. Thus KTBH follows option 1.

\not (h) This second occurrence of |hצְדָקָה |h*in the verse is omitted by LXX and some mss of Vul. Some modern translations (RSV, NRS) and commentators (WBC) follow this, but the word is retained by HOTTP. It should probably be retained, recognised as a word-play (cf NICOT) and seen to have a meaning different from the first occurrence. Most translations that retain it, render it by 'prosperity' or the like, and this fits well with its parallels, |hחַי|h* and |hכָּבוֹד|h*.

\not (j) |hצְדָקָה|h* may be an attribute of the city, but the context is one of deliverance and restoration, so it is better to take it as a reference to God's righteousness when he acts on behalf of a faithful, or in this case repentant, people.

\not (k) This assignment is debatable; the issue is whether vv 9-11 continue the confession of sin or represent an appeal to God for his saving |hמִשְׁפָּט|h* and |hצְדָקָה|h*. If 9a and 11b form an |iinclusio|i*, as Motyer notes (1993: 486), then |hיְשׁוּעָה|h* in v 11 points towards the latter.
\notfr (k) NOTE
\notsp (k) NOTE

\notxx (k) NOTE
\not (l) The assignment assumes that Yahweh loves to do righteousness, rather than that he loves righteousness done by others (contrast Psa 11:7). All the other attributes in vv 4-5 are God's. The context seems to be the whole of creation rather than the narrower covenant relationship with Israel.
\notfr (l) NOTE
\notsp (l) NOTE
\notpt (l) NOTE
\notxx (l) NOTE
\not (m) The suffix refers to God, so it is God's righteousness that is in view, but it is the king who is to exercise it (v 2), so this instance of the term is assumed to have a human as the main participant.

\notxx (m) NOTE
\not (n) On the basis of Phoenician inscriptions and Ugaritic texts, the theological dictionaries (TDOT, TLOT, NIDOTTE) and more recent commentaries (WBC, NICOT) argue for 'legitimate descendant' here and in 23:5. However, even the more recent translations do not follow them.

\intro This verb is not purely intellectual, but has moral connotations. It means 'to devote to something the attention and mental exertion that it deserves' (Meaning 1). When this appropriate insight is put into practice (Meaning 2), it has social consequences, for it often promotes honour. Neglecting |hשׂכל|h* leads to shame. So, the term is important from a cultural viewpoint.
\altint Gen 48:14 has been classified here as a separate Meaning (a homonym).

\addinfo The verb |hשׂכל|h* occurs 21x in Ben Sira, and is frequent in Qumran writings. See Fabry/Ringgren, |iTheologisches Wörterbuch zum Alten Testament|i* VII, 785, 794-5.

\syntagcc In this Use, the verb |hשׂכל|h* is often construed with the prepositions |hבְּ|h*, |hאֶל|h* or |hלְ|h*, which suggest different grades of attention (from|h בְּ |h*closest attention, very close to 'study', to |hלְ|h*, least close attention).
\keyref 3"0!'#"
\keyverse REB89 - Our forefathers in Egypt |bdisregarded |b*your marvels; they were not mindful of your many acts of love
\eval While REB has a good rendering, some versions have something less appropriate like 'did not understand' (TEV), 'did not perceive' (NJPS), which result in an awkward word pair with |hלֹא זכר|h* 'to remember not'. The meaning is not that the fathers did not perceive the wonders, but they paid no attention to them, i.e. disregarded them.
\trans |iMind that 'to pay due attention to' is not the same as looking from a distance, it also includes practical consequences. So in Proverbs 21:12 a translation like (KTBH) 'The righteous one |bappropriately deals|b* with the wicked household; he will bring the wicked down to ruin' is justified.

\keyverse REB89 - The Philistine commanders continued to make forays, but whenever they took the field David |bhad |b*more |bsuccess |b*against them than all the rest of Saul's men, and he won a great name for himself.
\eval Translations are fairly unanimous in rendering |hשׂכל |h*here. But we should keep in mind that it is not the western notion of 'success' (performing a task with good luck) that is intended here. Rather, the concept of honour is at stake (as the final clause shows). One could even translate 'David acted manfully/honourably/strategically'. Equally important is the rendering of the final clause, which is often flattened out as 'he became very famous' or the like (TEV, CEV). The salient point is not that his name became well-known, but that his honour increased . Since 'honour is a limited good', this automatically had damaging effects for the honour of other military leaders, including Saul. Therefore the REB rendering is better than others. Even better would be 'he / his name obtained great honour'.

\eval It is possible to render |hאַשְׂכִּילְךָ וְאוֹרְךָ|h* as one term, e.g. 'I will instruct', as TEV and CEV have done, depending on the type of translation chosen. If one wants to retain two different verbs one should not choose two verbs with an overlapping meaning, such as 'to teach' and 'to instruct', for in Hebrew the two terms are not really synonymous. It is notable that in Neh 9:20 God's spirit is the subject of the verb, and in Gen 3:6 a tree that imparts supernatural knowledge. Therefore a translation in the direction of 'to enlighten' seems preferable.

\not (a) Many English versions interpret |hצַדִּיק|h* as 'the Righteous (God)', because some find it hard to believe that the righteous cause the downfall of the wicked. But this is questionable. First, |hצַדִּיק|h* is never used as an (independent) epithet for YHWH in the OT, and second, YHWH is never subject of |hשׂכל|h* (Hiphil). Third, 'the righteous' is meant collectively here, so that the wicked are not ruined by an individual. See C.H. Toy, |iThe Book of Proverbs|i* (ICC), Edinburgh 1899 ad loc.; O.

\intro 1. This word refers primarily to priests serving God in the Tabernacle and the Temple.2.  It is also used for other priests of God and for priests of pagan gods.3.  In a few cases it refers to a special relationship with God.4.  In three places where the meaning is sometimes understood as 'royal adviser', KTBH prefers to understand a reference to an unofficial priesthood.
\tnotes 1. The role of a |hכֹּהֵן|h* is very different from that of the leaders of Christian congregations (see 'New Testament' below). Therefore it is inappropriate to translate this word with a term which is used primarily for Christian leaders.2. Uses 1b and 1d refer to the single High Priest, who had special functions. But this role was not clearly defined during the early monarchy period. In translation, a special word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be used when the Hebrew word is qualified by |hגָּדֹול|h* or |hרֹאשׁ|h*. When the Hebrew is simply |hכֹּהֵן|h* but the reference is to someone elsewhere identified as High Priest, the word or phrase for 'High Priest' may be appropriate, but other prominent named priests should not be assumed to be the High Priest.3. The leaders (plural) of the priests mentioned at 2 Chronicles 36:14 and Ezra 8:24, 29; 10:5 should be distinguished from the singular High Priest; a rendering like 'chief priests' may be misleading.4. |hכֹּהֵן|h*, and Aramaic |hכָּהֵן|h*, is related to the Arabic word |ikāhin|i*, which has been borrowed into other languages. The meaning in Arabic is rather different from the Hebrew, more like 'diviner', but in some other languages this word is used in the sense 'priest' and so may be an appropriate rendering of |hכֹּהֵן|h*.
\hebraist The noun |hכֹּהֵן|h* may be understood as the participle of the otherwise unknown Qal form of the verb |hכהן|h*.
\nt The Greek equivalents of |hכֹּהֵן|h*, |gἱερεύς|g*, also |gἀρχιερεύς|g* 'High Priest, chief priest', are used in the New Testament almost entirely of Jewish priests, and only once of pagan priests (Acts 14:13). They are used of Jesus Christ only in Hebrews. They are also used three times in Revelation (1:6; 5:10; 20:6; cf. |gἱεράτευμα|g* 'priesthood' 1 Peter 2:5,9) of all Christian believers; these uses allude to Exodus 19:6, and so relate to Meaning 3 below and bring out the idea of a priest as an intermediary between people and God but with no sacrificial function. But they are nowhere used as a specific term for Christian leaders, who did not offer sacrifices; their relationship with other Christians should not be compared to that of Jewish priests with other Jews.

\dfnotes |hכֹּהֵן|h* is a cultic term. The great majority of its uses refer to those charged with leading worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple. A smaller number relate to other worship of God and to worship of pagan gods. Just a few times the word is used to indicate a special relationship with God.The analysis of this word and of its cognates is based on an understanding that in Hebrew thinking there were several distinct domains of worship. These are distinguished by different settings, regulations, associations, and sequences of events, and by the biblical authors' different attitudes towards them. Therefore a distinction is made here between Worship in the Tabernacle and the Temple, Worship at local shrines (i.e. authorised worship led by Levites), Unofficial Israelite worship of God (including worship not authorised by the Law of Moses), Non-Israelite worship of God, and Worship of pagan gods. The precise distinctions between these domains are unclear, and sometimes depend on the different perspectives and evaluations of different biblical authors.The main duties of a priest in the Tabernacle and the Temple were to offer sacrifices. Subsidiary roles included teaching and prayer, and seeking guidance from God. Certain sacrifices could be offered only by the single High Priest. Priests at local shrines also offered some sacrifices, although this is not permitted by the law of Moses; this is why Josiah closed down the local shrines (2 Kings 23:8, 9). The main roles of non-Israelite priests also seem to have been sacrificial.

\not (a) Aramaic references.
\not (b) In this verse |hכֹּהֵן|h* is used in parallel with |hכֹּמֶר|h*, in a way suggesting that two different groups are referred to. The latter word surely refers to the priests of Baal, as in 2 Kings 23:5, and so it seems likely that the former refers to apostate priests of the Temple of God, cf. 3:4. Therefore this occurrence of |hכֹּהֵן|h* is listed under this contextual use.
\not (c) Aramaic |hעֲבִידָה|h*.
\not (d) The references listed here are only those in which the priests relate to the instruction or law as guardians or instructors.
\not (e) The High Priest is only sometimes distinguished by the qualifying terms |hמָשִׁיחַ, גָּדֹול, רֹאשׁ|h*. More often he is distinguished from other priests by longer expressions or from the context. Hilkiah seems to have been the first priest given the title |hהַכֹּהֵן הַגָּדֹול|h*, but some earlier priests were known as |hכֹּהֵן הָרֹאשׁ|h*.
\not (f) These named priests are not specifically called High Priest, although some of them seem to have served as such. In the early monarchy period there does not seem to have been a single High Priest; during David's reign Zadok and Abiathar seem to have shared the leading role.Included here are the following references to priests by name:|hאֶלְעָזָר |h*Eleazar (before the death of Aaron): NUM 3:32; 4:16; 17:2,4; 19:3,4|hאִיתָמָר |h*Ithamar: EXO 38:21; NUM 4:28,33; 7:8|hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas, son of Eleazar: NUM 25:7,11; 31:6; JOS 22:13,30,31,32|hעֵלִי |h*Eli: 1SA 1:9; 2:11; 14:3|hחָפְנִי |h*Hophni and |hפִּינְחָס |h*Phinehas: 1SA 1:3|hאֲחִימֶלֶךְ |h*Ahimelech: 1SA 21:2,3; 22:11; 2SA 8:17; 1CH 18:16|hאֶבְיָתָר |h*Abiathar: 1SA 23:9; 30:7; 2SA 15:35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:7,19,25,42; 2:22,26,27; 4:4; 1CH 15:11|hצָדֹוק |h*Zadok: 2SA 8:17; 15:27,35,35; 17:15; 19:12; 20:25; 1KI 1:8,26,32,34,38,39,44,45; 2:35; 4:4; 1CH 15:11; 16:39; 18:16; 24:6; 29:22|hעֲזַרְיָהוּ |h*Azariah: 1KI 4:2|hיְהֹויָדָע |h*Jehoiada: 2KI 11:9,9,15; 12:3,8,10; 2CH 22:11; 23:8,8,9,14; 24:2,20,25; and an earlier Jehoiada: 1CH 27:5; and a later Jehoiada: JER 21:26|hאוּרִיָּה |h*Uriah: 2KI 16:10,11,11,15,16|hפַּשְׁחוּר |h*Pashhur: JER 20:1|hצְפַנְיָהוּ |h*Zephaniah: 2KI 25:18; JER 21:1,25,29; 37:3; 52:24|hיְהֶזְקֵאל|h* Ezekiel: EZK 1:3|hעֶזְרָא  |h*Ezra: EZR 7:11,12,21; 10:10,16; NEH 8:2,9; 12:26|hמְרֵמֹות |h*Meremoth: EZR 8:33

\not (i) These references seem to be to a priesthood in Israel predating and separate from the order of Aaron - including in Psalm 99:6 where Moses as well as Aaron is named as a priest.
\not (j) 2 Samuel 8:18 seems to state clearly that David's sons were priests; compare also 2 Samuel 20:26 and 1 Kings 4:5. But this contradicts the law of Moses which allows only descendants of Aaron to be priests. The Levitical priests Zadok and Ahimelech are listed in verse 17. So it is often suggested that here |hכֹּהֵן|h* means not 'priest' but 'royal adviser', as in NIV; compare LXX |gαὐλάρχης |g*'chief of the court'. However, the law of Moses was not obeyed in every detail during the time of David, and the text should not be adjusted to make it appear that it was.In the parallel passage, 1 Chronicles 18:17, the text reads, in place of 'priests', literally 'first to the hand of the king'. It seems probable that the text of 2 Samuel was changed in 1 Chronicles as part of its presentation of David as an ideal king who observed the law of Moses. The LXX translator may have had similar reasons for adjusting the text.In the light of Psalm 110:4, it is possible that David appointed his sons to the priesthood of God Most High who was worshipped in pre-Israelite Jerusalem, i.e. as successors of Melchizedek. (In the light of the New Testament, these sons of David would also be precursors of the greater Son of David who was also called a priest of the order of Melchizedek, Hebrews 6:20.)
\not (k) The text of Hosea 4:4 is commonly emended e.g. to 'for with you is my contention, O priest' (RSV), which implies that the addressee Israel is here being referred to as a priest. But the text as written makes sense, and is accurately translated 'for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest' (NIV). The meaning of this in context is obscure, but the priest referred to here, as elsewhere in Hosea (cf. Amos 7:10 where this is clear), is presumably one of the non-Aaronic priests of the northern kingdom of Israel.
\not (l) In view of v.18 and 1 Kings 16:31, 32, it is assumed that the priests mentioned in 2 Kings 10:11 are priests of Baal, not non-Aaronic priests of God. But it is possible that priests of God are also being referred to here.

\sub ערם
\intro The noun |hעָרְמָה|h* does not necessarily have a pejorative meaning. In several cases, notably in Proverbs, it can better be translated as 'astuteness' or 'shrewdness' than as 'cunning', which has stronger negative associations.
\hebraist See See Fox, M.V. 1993 "Words for Wisdom." |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*6: 149-169.
\dfnotes As TWAT VI,388 notes, both |hעָרְמָה|h* and |hמְזִמָּה|h* hold the border line with the pejoratives (cunning, craftiness). This is related to the fact that in ancient Israel, wisdom education concentrated on intellectual attitudes rather than on morality. W. McKane rightly stresses in his |iProverbs|i* commentary (London 1970, 265): 'Wisdom did not educate men to change the world, but to make their way successfully in the world as it was.' Or in Fox's words: 'This [i.e. that Wisdom boasts proximity to |hעָרְמָה|h*, Pro 8:12] does not make |hעָרְמָה|h* an inherently virtuous ability; rather it is a practical faculty that wisdom promises its adherents.'

\intro The meaning can be defined as follows: 'to put together a plan or strategy to act on, often with an outcome that is damaging to someone else, without yet having put it into effect.'At first sight, many contexts suggeste a negative connotation. However since the verb itself can be used for positive plans, the purpose of damaging someone is not essential to the verb. A rendering of this verb must be chosen carefully to avoid inappropriate connotations (either good when the context suggests bad or vice versa).
\hebraist For further study, see Botterweck/Ringgren, |iTheologisches Wörterbuch zum Alten Testament|i*, Bd. II, 601.N.B. In Genesis 11:6 the form|h יָזְמוּ |h*is hypercorrect, i.e. it has been approximated towards a regular Qal form of the strong verb. The normal form for geminate verbs would be |hיָזֹמּוּ |h*cf. Joüon-Muraoka, |iGrammar of Biblical Hebrew|i*, par. 83j.
\addinfo One would expect that the verb |hזמם|h* would occur often in wisdom literature, but that is not the case. The related noun |hמְזִמָּה|h* does occur in Proverbs quite often as one of the words for prudence. It seems that |hזמם|h* chiefly denotes strategic activity of the mind without moral judgement.

\sub זמם
\intro The meaning of this word can be defined as 'Plan or strategy that someone has thought out to accomplish a well-defined goal'. From 'plan' there is an extension of meaning to 'the |iability|i* of planning'. The word sometimes occurs in the negative sense of 'plotting', 'scheming' but this is not part of the lexical meaning.
\hebraist See Fox, M.V. 1993 "Words for Wisdom." |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*6: 149-169.
\dfnotes |hמְזִמָּה|h* is part of the Wisdom frame. The mental skill (that can be acquired) is not traditional knowledge but a personal initiative: thinking out a strategy or plan in order to achieve a goal. In wisdom literature, where the son is taught to find his way into the world, |hמְזִמָּה|h* is valued quite positively. But otherwise |hמְזִמָּה|h* features in contexts where the Agents start to look primarily after their own objectives, which results in 'scheming' which damages other people. Perhaps  |hמְזִמָּה|h* is less positively valued in cultures where private enterprise is less appreciated. A culture that is tradition-centered will not favour innovative enterprises.
\addinfo The noun |hמְזִמָּה|h* is linked with |hחשׁב |h*'to think, plan' and its derivatives several times, which indicates that we are dealing with a mental activity. Likewise, it is often juxtaposed with verbs like |hעשׂה|h* ' to do, make' and |hיכל|h* 'to succeed' which indicates that what is lacking from |hמְזִמָּה|h* is the execution of the plans.Just as with |hזמם|h* 'to plan, plot', negative connotations are part of the context, not necessarily central to the noun |hמְזִמָּה|h* itself (see, e.g., Job 21:27, where it is conveyed by the verb |hחמס|h* 'to plot violence', and the article by Fox). It is notable, however, that the plural |hמְזִמֹּות|h* is limited to instances where a negative frame (damage to others) is invoked (Pro 14:17; Psa 139:20). But here the logical extension of meaning is that a 'man of plans' (Fox: '... private thoughts') is not, as in the Western world, an enterprising fellow who is bound for success, but a schemer, so that the pejorative connotation has often become part of the plural of this noun.

\not (a) Because of the irregular features of MT, any translation can only be a tentative one. HOTTP advises to adhere to MT, as usual, but many versions adopt one or more text-critical changes, and understandably so. We advise to change |hהָרַבִּים|h* 'the many' into |hהַנְּדָרִים|h* 'the vows', not only for semantic but also for syntactic reasons because this minimal change provides |hיַעַבְרוּ |h*with a grammatical subject. The verse could then be rendered literally as follows: 'What does my beloved do in My house? Execute [evil] plans? Vows and holy [=sacrificial] flesh will depart from you. If evil hits you, you may exult!' (The last clause is ironical.)

\intro 1. The Meanings of this word are all related to a central meaning, 'wisdom', 'expertise'.2. The Hebrew concept of 'wisdom, expertise' is wider than the Western idea of wisdom (see Domain and Frame Notes).3. With respect to crafts, it denotes skill in a profession (Meaning 1a).4. With respect to all other kinds of tasks in life, it denotes wisdom, insight and prudence (Meaning 1b).5. 'Wisdom' is also the name of a Lady, who personifies wisdom and the desire to make foolish people wise (Meaning 2).

\dfnotes The Hebrew root חכם 'to be wise' and its derivatives can serve as a good heading for the Wisdom frame, for it encompasses all other terms related to wisdom. At first sight, its translation does not seem to pose grave problems. Relevant dictionary entries are often quite straightforward and modern versions are almost unanimous in their use of '(to be) wise' and 'wisdom' as its renderings. Most of the secondary literature does not deal with the semantic or cultural meanings, but with the socio-cultural setting of the Wisdom tradition, its international character, its development throughout Wisdom literature etc. The standard rendering חכם = 'wise' may be an attractive and often quite adequate choice, which mirrors the conceptual unity of the Old Testament. Nevertheless, we should be aware of different connotations of wisdom between ancient Israel and the modern Western world, to which many scholars and dictionary writers belong. A scholar that does express sensitivity to the differences is M.V. Fox in his |iProverbs 1-9|i* (Anchor Bible Commentary), New York 2000, 29, 32ff. He defines חָכְמָה as 'a high degree of knowledge and skill in any domain' and thus allows a much wider sense for the Hebrew term than its English counterpart 'wisdom' usually has. He suggests that English 'tends to distinguish, perhaps too sharply, between knowledge and intelligence' (32). There are two important differences between the Hebrew and English concepts of 'wisdom'.The first difference is the following. In both Hebrew and English phraseology, wisdom is believed to be located in the 'heart'. But it is important to remind ourselves that the concept 'heart' fulfills different functions in ancient Israelite and modern Western thought. In English, the concept 'heart' is the seat of the emotions, notably love, with which it is symbolically associated. In Hebrew thinking, לֵב 'heart' is the centre of the will and of the rational faculties. Often לֵב can be translated as 'mind' or 'brain'. The חָכְמָה 'wisdom'-activities of the Hebrew 'heart' would be referred to in English as 'intelligence', in the widest sense of the word (comprising both IQ and EQ [Emotional Intelligence]). Emotional Intelligence, as is it conceived in the West, is a fruitful interaction between emotions and rational faculties, resulting in 'emotional management', so that an emotionally intelligent person knows how to handle his own emotions, how to handle situations, how to use emotions for the best etc. In short, Emotional Intelligence equals the Western concept of 'wisdom'. Modern textbooks contrast Emotional Intelligence with professional expertise. A 'computer nerd' may be a good professional, but he is emotionally and socially handicapped. But the Hebrew term חָכְמָה covers both professional/rational and emotional/social expertise. Next to 'wisdom', 'expertise' would also be a good gloss for חָכְמָה. Judged from the modern Western perspective, the Book of Proverbs would not typically be called a treasure of wisdom. Modern critics have called it 'a collection of platitudes', and this (exaggerated) judgement does reflect some of the different attitudes towards wisdom then and now. In short, the Hebrew wisdom frame is much wider than its English counterpart. The former includes professional skill, rational faculties, usable for different purposes, interpersonal skills and, generally, the art of living.The second difference is that in English, 'wisdom' has positive overtones: wisdom is inherently 'good', to speakers of English. Using wisdom for bad purposes is considered something of an impossibility|i; |i*that would be called 'shrewdness' or 'cunning'. This is different in Hebrew, where חָכְמָה can definitely be used for evil purposes (2SA 13:3; JOB 5:13 etc.). Seen from this perspective, it becomes clearer why some Bible passages stress that wisdom equals 'righteousness'. For that was by no means clear to Israelites from their understanding of חָכְמָה. Also, that wisdom begins with the 'fear of the Lord'|i |i*had to be |iasserted|i*, it was clearly not taken for granted. The entire frame of חָכְמָה 'wisdom', as well as several sub-terms such as ערם, עָרְמָה, זמם, מְזִמָּה, thus has a more neutral and instrumental (i.e. usable for good and bad purposes) character than the English wisdom frame.

A more modest way of reaching this purpose is to formulate an appropriate section heading, such as 'Lady Wisdom invites new pupils' or 'Wisdom, personified as a woman, invites people to become wise'.

\intro Ten of the 22 occurrences are found in Ezekiel and nine of these ten are in the three watchman passages (3:16-21; 18:1-32; 33:1-20), where it has a restricted sense. It is used there to describe the sin that a righteous person commits when he turns from his righteousness to commit various unrighteous acts. This meaning is illustrated in 18:26: |ibshuv-tsadiq mitsidqato ve'asa 'avel umet 'aleyhem b'avlo 'asher-'asa yamut|i*.Someone commits |i‘avel|i* when he treats others unfairly or dishonestly even though his position or role requires him to deal with them fairly and honestly. People living in a community that is largely law-abiding expect that a person who has been entrusted with a responsible role (such as a judge or a seller in the marketplace) will act in just and principled ways towards them. But in the case of |i‘avel|i*, though they deserve and expect justice, they find that the expected behaviour of a |itsadiq|i* (‘a righteous person’) has been abandoned and replaced by injustice and dishonesty. All occurrences of |i'avel|i* entail an unexpected distortion of the accepted standards of right and proper behaviour when dealing with other humans. They, therefore, result in a breach of trust between the agent of the injustice or dishonesty and its victim. The biblical occurrences can be sorted into three kinds of sin:1. Commercial dishonesty; unfair business practices (Lev 19:35; Deu 25:16; Ezk 28:18). 2. Courtroom injustice; unfairness in deciding legal cases (Lev 19:15; Ezk 18:8; Job 34:10; Psa 82:2).  3. Wrongful acts in general that involve a deliberate choice away from the expected righteous behaviour. A list of various sins is repeated three times in Ezekiel 18:5-19, where |i‘avel |i*is sometimes seen as a cover term for the whole list (eg Ezk 18:24). This broader meaning of |i'avel|i* may be used in protests of innocence, where the defendant, whether God (Deu 32:4; Jer 2:5) or some other righteous person (Psa 7:4; and Job 34:32) testifies that he has not abandoned his righteousness. Also included in this category are the remaining occurrences in Ezekiel (and possibly Psa 53:2 and Pro 29:27).[Residue: The kinds of sin referred to in Psalm 53:2 and Proverbs 29:27 are less clear from the context, but their contexts do not exclude them from any of the above. The occurrence in Ezekiel 18:8 is preceded by commercial dishonesty (specifically the charging of interest) and followed by courtroom injustice. But the lines remain balanced (with two clauses on each theme), if |i‘avel |i*relates to courtroom injustice rather than commercial dishonesty.]

\comp The word is used to refer to particular days (Meanings 1 - 5) or to periods of days (Meaning 6). It is also used within discourse to evoke elapsed time and to locate an event in time (that is to say relative to other events which are unfolding) (Meanings 7 - 10). There can be some ambiguity between these two ways of categorising, for instance a particular day may also be a day in the unfolding of a discourse. We have tried to categorise on the basis of which is most prominent for each instance [see below for example]. Within Meanings 1 - 5, the entry can be seen as reflecting various aspects of dayness, referred to linguistically as perspectivisation. The word can also be used adverbially (Meaning 11) to attribute a 'daily-ness' (or other period of repetitiveness) to an activity, or adjectively (Meaning 12), for instance of an allotment appropriate to a day.Example of categorisation: Hosea 10:9 "Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned...". This is an example of 'days' referring to (i) a period of time, to (ii) a significant event (in particular, a significant |inegative|i* event.) It could be categorised in one of those ways. However it is also an example of the time of one event (the heinous event invoked by 'Gibeah') being related to the time of another event ('sinning'). Since, in reality, Israelite sinning did not start with the event invoked by 'Gibeah', this event is being called to mind as a prominent event to show that Israelite sinning has been going on for a long time. We have therefore categorised it primarily as a 'discourse' use of 'day', since this seems to be the most prominent frame. The other two or three categories may appear as contextual domains.[examples][multiple categorisation]I Samuel 14:52 - All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.[life of ruler, time when, discourse role] - <life of ruler> as being more culturally cognitive could take priority[researcher's note] It may be appropriate to point out nominal and adjectival (eg. they were 'old') use.

\meaning day as 'time now'
\syntagc as a basic time word, 'this day' in Biblical Hebrew is often used to denote the present time; the extent to which the present period of daylight or period of daylight and night are relevant to this varies from context to context, and cannot easily be separated out (cf. 'adhoc' usage)[note] need to sort out treatment of 'kayyom' (e.g. 1 Samuel 9:27) - see 4(d)
\level3 a
\context no particular context
\syntagcc obviously time of speaker, which may be narratorJoshua 22 is a good example - all occurrences of 'yom' in that chapter are 'today' or 'now' (also most in chap 23+24)Deut 11:4 - "lasting[ruin]" - review e.g. Deut 31:21,27; [note] in 1Sam 9:9 it is attribute of noun[note] review 'kayyom' construction here too (can be translated 'for a while', ?'(for) a moment')

\frame temporal event relationship in a discourse
\syntagc The same distinctions could be made for 'Time Then' as are in 'Time When'. However the following distinctions appeared to be more relevant and useful. 'Time Then' is associated with a main clause, and the reader/hearer will enrich it with contextual information ('Time When', by contrast, is associated with a subordinate clause which specifies the time.) The time can be a period during which an event or events take place. Or it can be a time after which events (start to) take place.

\sub חָכָם. חָכְמָה
\intro The Hebrew root |hחכם|h* has a more rational connotation than English ‘wise’, which is rather an affair of intuition. In Hebrew, wisdom is more linked to IQ than to EQ (Emotional Quotient), more to Rational Intelligence than to Emotional Intelligence. Under the related entry |hחָכְמָה|h* (Domain and frame notes) you will find an explanation of what this means.
\hebraist The references under the Meaning 'To make wise' have been taken together here, but there is a difference between Piel and Hiphil, however small. The Piel basically designates bringing about a state, referred to by the base root, or it designates bringing about the outcome of the action designated by the base root. The Piel thus causes a state rather than an action, which is the characteristic of the Hiphil.When applied to|h חכם|h*, this means that the Piel |hחִכֵּם |h*designates bringing about the state of being informed and/or the possession of relevant knowledge - perhaps even against the will of the Patient, whereas the Hiphil |hהֶחְכִּים |h*designates bringing about the event of being actively wise. This distinction fits well to the references listed below. The Torah makes those who study and observe it into men who are wise and who act wisely (Psa 19:8; 119:98, both Hiphil). On the other hand, animals have been made ‘wise’ in the sense of 'programmed for their particular task', not actively wise in the strict sense of the word (Pro 30:24, Pual=Passive Piel). The same holds true for the Egyptian officials, of whom it is said in a deprecatory way that they were 'made wise', i.e. instructed to obey Joseph for that moment (Psa 105:22, Piel). If the target language allows it, these distinctions should be reflected in translation.For further reading: B. K. Waltke & M. O'Connor, |iBiblical Hebrew Syntax|i*, Winona Lake 1990, par. 24. and 27.

\eval English translations show complete unaninimity in choosing ‘to be wise’ as the rendering of |hחכם|h* in virtually all of its occurrences. Since the Hebrew root designates a more rational type of wisdom than English 'wise', renderings like 'to be clever', 'to be intelligent', 'to be adroit'. But the traditional rendering 'to be wise' lends the Biblical books at least a conceptual unity.

\eval The writer warns against an overkill in intentional 'wise' behaviour. 'Acting as if', as expressed by the Hitpael (Joüon-Muraoka, |iGrammar of Biblical Hebrew|i*, par. 53i), has a suggestion of intentionality (as appears from Exo 1:10). Therefore this rendering seems better then 'do not be over-wise' (REB) or the like.

\not (a) If MT is retained, as HOTTP advises, the text means that Joseph could 'bind' Egyptian officials, i.e. discipline them and so force them to obey his will. Many commentaries and dictionaries propose to read |hלְיַסֵּר|h* 'to teach' instead of |hלֶאְסֹר|h* 'to bind', with an appeal to LXX and the Vulgate. This is attractive, because it yields a smoother parallelism.

\intro 1. The Meanings of this word are all related to a central meaning, 'wise', 'expert'.2. The Hebrew concept of 'wisdom, expertise' is wider than the Western idea of wisdom (see Domain and Frame Notes under חָכְמָה).3. With respect to crafts, it denotes skill in a profession (Meaning 1a).4. With respect to all other kinds of tasks in life, it denotes wisdom, insight and prudence (Meaning 1b).5. The word also refers to a class of specialists, often in political or religious affairs.

\sub אול
\intro 1. Hebrew words for different types of fools (including בער, כְּסִיל, נָבָל ,סכל, פֶּתִי) are not synonymous. 2. The אֱוִיל is a person who is foolish, despises wisdom and even enjoys bad things.3. The word can function both as a noun and as an adjective.4. For the difference with כְּסִיל, see that entry (Comments for Hebraists).
\hebraist If we do not count 2 Ki 24:15 (preferring the |iQere |i*אֵילֵי over the Ketib אֱוִלֵי, this word has 26 occurrences in the OT. Additionally it occurs 4x in Ben Sira. See: Fox M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly" |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15; Bruce Waltke, |iProverbs |i*(NICOT), section (3), 'Two Words for Fool'.For the difference between כְּסִיל 'complacent fool' and אֱוִיל, see the Comments for Hebraists under כְּסִיל.
\comp 1. Frame: Folly; Experiencer: human   1.a. adjective   1.b. noun
\dfnotes One would think that terms in the Folly frame would typically negate terms of the Wisdom frame, but  there are two indications that this is not the case. First, folly terms cannot be mapped as standard negative counterparts of wisdom terms, like 'wise - unwise', 'intelligent - unintelligent' etc. So, it is not the case that e.g. אִוֶּלֶת 'foolishness' would be the standard antonym of חָכְמָה 'wisdom', סִכְלוּת 'folly' the antonym of עָרְמָה 'cunning, astuteness' etc. The Folly frame is mapped along lines that seem to be independent of those in the Wisdom frame. (However, in the book of Proverbs חָכָם 'wisdom' is so often contrasted to כְּסִיל 'complacent fool' that THAT II, 838 speaks of an antitype.)Second, - in fact an illustration of the first point - whereas the Wisdom frame contains a series of nouns that are connected with verbs (e.g. חָכְמָה 'wisdom' with חכם 'to be wise', עָרְמָה 'astuteness' with ערם 'to be cunning, astute' etc.), the Folly frame possesses a series of adjectives and nouns but often lacks corresponding verbs.

\intro 1. The אֱוִיל is a foolish person who, as a result of moral corruption, refuses to make the right moral choices. 2. The moral corruption of אֱוִיל and אִוֶּלֶת is shown by the frequent contrast with words like 'upright' and 'righteous'. 3. The אֱוִיל does not bother to contain his anger or other unproductive emotions.
\hebraist This word occurs also 5x in Ben Sira.Reference: Fox M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly" |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15.
\altint Several Hebrew terms relating to folly are too often rendered as 'fool', 'folly' in English versions. However, a closer look reveals that these terms (including |hבער, כְּסִיל, נָבָל ,סכל, פֶּתִי) are not synonymous. Fox defines אֱוִיל, for example, as 'moral corruption from the standpoint of its impact on judgement and reason'. Accordingly, the אֱוִיל is a person who, as a result of moral corruption, refuses to make the right moral choices. It is thus for good reason that אֱוִיל and אִוֶּלֶת are often contrasted with words like 'upright' and 'righteous'. The fool does not bother to contain his anger or other unproductive emotions.

\heb כְּסִיל
\level1 1
\strong 3684
\gloss (Complacent) fool
\freq 75
\sub כסל
\intro 1. The word can function both as an adjective and as a noun.2. Characteristic of the כְּסִיל is stupidity combined with complacency. 3. The כְּסִיל does not see the harmful consequences of his actions, or does not care about them. 4. For the difference with אֱוִיל, see Comments for Hebraists.5. A separate Meaning (homonym) of כְּסִיל is 'Orion' (a constellation of stars).6. Another separate meaning (homonym) is a place name.
\hebraist According to most scholars, this word can be derived from a root meaning 'to be fat'. From this, its meaning gradually developed to 'to be slow' and 'to be stupid'. Following Fox's article, we could paraphrase the meaning of the noun כְּסִיל as follows: the כְּסִיל is someone who is not very clever, and shows too much satisfaction with who he is and what he does. He is so satisfied with himself that his judgement and his brain do not work well anymore. He does not see the harmful consequences of his rash words or his actions, and if he sees them, he does not care about them. In this way he, and other people with him, come to harm.The difference with אֱוִיל is difficult to draw, because the book of Proverbs ascribes similar behaviour to both כְּסִיל and אֱוִיל. Several scholars think it is not possible to make a distinction. However, it is hard to believe that two words have exactly the same meaning. Fox suggests a difference. According to him, the כְּסִיל 'complacent fool' does stupid and wrong things |ibecause |i*he is foolish and satisfied with himself, whereas the אֱוִיל is morally perverse, and this |imakes him do |i*foolish things. Fox finds it striking that the כְּסִיל is sometimes mentioned in one breath with someone who knows nothing (Psa 49:11; 92:7; 94:8). There is little hope of educating the כְּסִיל, but it is not impossible (Pro 8:5b), but there is nowhere any mention of improving an אֱוִיל. So its seems that the אֱוִיל is a hardened version of the כְּסִיל, for he despises wisdom (Pro 1:7), is incorrigible (Pro 27:22). It is also interesting that אֱוִיל and אִוֶּלֶת, in contrast to כְּסִיל, are sometimes contrasted with words like 'upright' and 'righteous'. The folly of the אֱוִיל goes to the extent that he is fond of doing evil. He does not make amends for what he has done (Pro 14:9). With respect to the connection of Folly terms and morality, we should note that how Israelites understood folly would be different from a modern Western analysis by virtue of their being a high-contact society. That is to say, people in the West would view 'folly' as more an individual thing - in the first place affecting or being to the detriment of the individual. Folly could concern immorality but not necessarily; it could simply be with money, for instance. In a high-contact society, such ancient Israel, but also many Asian and African societies of the present, 'folly' would be felt by the society. Folly is then, in a sense, an irresponsible behaviour towards the society and to the detriment of the society, in particular the immediate family. In this way, folly so can seen as 'immoral', because the ‘fool’ does not fulfil his proper role in society that a group mentality would require, where each member is expected to contribute to the societal good. One might do it by being 'simple', another by being 'lazy', another by being 'petulant'. Reference: Fox, M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly" |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15; B. Waltke, |iProverbs|i* (NICOT), section (3), 'Two Words for Fool'.This word occurs also 5x in Ben Sira.

\sub לָצוֹן, מְלִיצָה
\intro 1. This verb denotes insolence and disdainful and contemptuous treatment of others.2. There is a homonym, meaning 'to act as an intermediary' (either as an interpreter or as a mediator).
\hebraist The occurrences of לֵץ (occurring another 8x in Ben Sira) and מֵלִיץ have been subsumed under this entry, although some dictionaries (HALOT e.g.) treat them as nouns of its own. The relationship of Meaning 3 to Meanings 1 and 2 is disputed. Some propose a homonym, but others see a common base to all three Meanings, 'to talk freely, to talk big'.References: |iTheologisches Woerterbuch zum AT|i* IV, 567-572; Fox, M.V. 1997 "Words for Folly", |iZeitschrift für Althebraistik |i*10:4-15.
\altint Traditional English versions render לֵץ as 'mocker' or 'scoffer', but that is misleading, as has already been argued by Buhl in 1913 and by other scholars since (see TWAT IV, 567f.). Why misleading? The main reason is that deriding other people's beliefs and repudiating intellectual principles is not the meaning of this verb. Rather, it denotes insolence and disdainful and contemptuous treatment of others, as LXX has well understood (which interprets it as 'insolence', 'haughtiness'). Fox defines it as 'arrogance manifest as contempt for other people and ideas'.

A |hנָבָל|h* is a typical perpetrator of |hנְבָלָה|h* (see also that entry), a wanton and brutish act towards someone or a wanton and brutish disregard of something.

\eval English versions often offer 'fool' as a rendering, but this only partially covers the desired meaning. Therefore new Bible translations should try to move away from this traditional but inadequate rendering. Alternatives from existing Bible translations include 'villain', 'scoundrel', 'churl'. The English term 'boor' seems a better candidate, but it is not often used (e.g. REB Pro 17:21), probably because it sounds too coarse in the Bible. Nevertheless this term is strong in Hebrew, so it should sound strong in a target language.

\syntagc Nabal's farm is located in Carmel, in the south-east of Judah, and his name probably reflects influence of Arabic dialects in the border regions of Judah. Nabil is a popular name in Arabic to this day. It goes without saying that Nabil doesn't mean 'boor' in Arabic, and that no father would dream of calling his son Boor. But to the Israelite audience the association of Nabal with 'boor' cannot be missed.

\syntagcc The exaggeration that Nabal's conduct is designated by the extreme term |hנְבָלָה|h* (see that entry) may be deliberate, serving to placate David’s anger, which is Abigail’s main purpose.

\eval All English versions transliterate the name as Nabal. But this is a clear case where the author plays on the meaning of the Hebrew word |hנָבָל|h*. Nabal in fact embodies the boor in optima forma; notions of honour / shame, ingratitude, provocation are eminently present. It thus does not comes as a surprise that verse 25 makes this connection explicit. It would be very nice when a language has the possibility to imitate this wordplay. European languages do not offer this possibility.

\sub נבל
\intro 1. The term נְבָלָה indicates a flagrant violation of the most revered standards of morality.2. It can be defined as a wanton brutish act towards someone or a wanton brutish disregard of something.3. The doer of נְבָלָה lacks any sense of honour and shame.4. An important element in the meaning is: extremity, i.e. the enormity of the crime, its extreme offensiveness.5. It provokes public outrage and God’s indignation, resulting in extreme responses and actions.
\evalev BDB defines this noun as ‘disgraceful folly (wanton deed)’. HALOT also gives two meanings: ‘stupidity, folly’ (1Sa 25:25; Job 42:8) and ‘wilful sin, sacrilege’. HALOT’s analysis of this word is a significant improvement on BDB’s, but it still retains the idea of folly in two instances. Yet there is nothing in the context of these two instances that would necessarily prevent the scandal frame from being evoked, albeit with some elements behaving as weaker implicatures. Despite the weaker implicatures, the offences referred to by this expression are far more damaging and shocking than mere ‘disorderly conduct’ or ‘folly’. Nevertheless, in Deu 32:6 the related noun נָבָל is contrasted to חָכָם, which signals that the Wisom/Folly frame is certainly present.

\dfnotes This word belongs, together with others, in the overachring Sin frame. There are two main differences from the usages of most other evaluative terms for sin. The standards violated are worthy of greater respect and the effects are more extreme. 1.	SynonymsOur focus term (|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’) is related to Hebrew words for sin, horror, disgrace, and outrage. For instance, HALOT defines |hשַׁמָּה|h* as ‘horrific, atrocious event (always referring to destruction following judgement)’. Both |hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime' and |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refer to events that cause horror. But, while |hנְבָלָה|h* refers to horrific criminal acts, |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refers to horrific acts of desolation, often as punishment for criminal acts. While |hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime' refers to the kinds of events that call for swift judgment, |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ refers to the acts of judgment themselves that are called for by serious crimes. The causative relationships may be shown like this:|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’ > horror > judgement > |hשַׁמָּה|h* ‘atrocious destruction’ > more horror2. Contrasting Focus of Synonyms|hנְבָלָה|h* ‘scandalous crime’ perspectivises the extreme reaction of outrage to the sinful event.

\syntagcc The fixed expression ‘to commit a scandalous crime in Israel’ emphasises two things about such crimes: (1) they offend the public conscience of the nation as a whole, causing a nation-wide outcry and (2) the whole nation is implicated in the crime and must be purged by getting rid of the perpetrators from among them (cf. Deu 22:21; Jos 7; Jdg 19-20).

After all, by prostituting herself while under her father's authority, her |boffence has caused a scandal|b* among the people of Israel!
\eval Translators should find a strongly-worded expression that emphasises both the enormity of the offence (to God and to the entire community) and the serious consequences it brings (to the doer and to the community as a whole). CEV renders the fixed expression as ‘brought evil into your community’. This conveys part of the significance of the fixed expression. But since this aspect is already represented elsewhere in the verse, it is better at this point to emphasise the extreme offensiveness of the crime - one that should cause an outrage throughout all Israel. Unlike other modern translations, however, the CEV unambiguously shows that the fixed expression properly refers to the people of Israel, not to the land of Israel.REB renders the fixed expression as ‘committed an outrage in Israel’ (cf. ESV). This accurately portrays the idea of scandal, as does a noun like ‘infamy’ (NJB and TOB). GW’s ‘godless act’ may not always evoke the idea of public scandal for all English speakers, but it is better than the following. Several other translations are only a little astray by employing adjectives such as ‘disgraceful’ (NIV, NRSV, NLT, NCV, EIN) or ‘shameful’ (TEV, NJPS). Those that use ‘folly’ (LXX, RSV, NASB) are far from signifying the horrific enormity of the offence.The tentative KTBH rendering offered here redistributes semantic features. Where it says literally 'she did נְבָלָה among Israel', the notion of offence is made more explicit in: 'her offence caused a scandal among the people of Israel.'

\eval Many English translations still use terms like ‘folly’ (KJV, NRSV, NAB), ‘foolishness’ (NASB, GW), ‘foolishly’ (CEV) and ‘madness’ (NJB). Exceptions include ‘impiety’ (REB, NJPS), ‘evil’ (TEV) and ‘lies’ (NLT and NCV). But the guilt of the Israelites in Isaiah’s time was far greater than foolish lies would cause. Their scandalous words were no mere slips of the tongue or insignificant blunders, made because they were ignorant and foolish. Such meanings might be signalled when English words like ‘folly’ are used. Translators might consider explicitly stating the nature of the crime and the identity of the victim, such as ‘shocking lies about God’.

\eval The set of ideas prompted by the use of this noun will often require an expansive translation. Some elements may be omitted by simply conveying that God is not going to punish them as harshly as they deserve, as some modern versions do. A word like ‘folly’ does not render this noun’s meaning forcefully enough, despite CEV, NRSV, NCV, NIV and NASB. It could be an idea to make the connection between the offence and the punishment more explicit so that the notion of |hנְבָלָה|h* is clearly dissociated from YHWH: 'And then I will accept his prayer not to punish you as severely|i as your sacrilegious talk about me deserves.'|i* But the NJPS translation is also acceptable, although it presupposes that YHWH is the Agent (which brings it under Meaning 1.).

\not (a) The meaning of דור in this verse is disputed. Watts (Word Biblical Commentary 1987) summarises representative opinion as follows: "Nyborg (... [1974]...) supports the usual meaning of the word, arguing that it is not used in Heb. or other Semitic languages with the meaning 'dwelling'. But most translators have insisted that in this one case the context requires the meaning of 'dwelling' and by |itour de force|i* keep it.... This translation [the WBC translation] prefers the usual meaning of the word even if it is awkward." It may be appropriate to follow the majority translations of your region. CEV (and NLT) translate דורי in this verse by "my life".

Because of this, translations such as 'laborer' (NRS, NJPS), 'labourer' (NJB) and 'workers' (CEV) are acceptable, but in other contexts it will be necessary to make explicit the fact that the worker has been hired.  This has been done by means of phrases in some translations, e.g. 'someone you have hired' (TEV), 'hired servant' (RSV), and 'hired man' (NIV, REB).

\keyverse That day the Lord will shave, with a razor |bhired |b*from the other side of the River (with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the leg, and take off the beard, too. (NJB)
\eval Most translations retain a literal translation of this phrase due to the extended nature of the metaphor of shaving with a razor. As is true with many metaphors, some aspects of the normal meaning of the word are not easily interpreted.  When an item is hired, the payment is usually made to the owner of the item.  God obviously is not making a monetary payment to a person for the use of the 'razor', though the CEV does translate it in that way, 'The Lord will pay the king of Assyria to bring a razor from across the River Euphrates and shave your head and every hair on your body, including your beard. (CEV)' The TEV translates in a similar manner, 'the Lord will hire a barber from across the Euphrates'. The CEV and TEV are not recommended models. Because of the difficulty of understanding to whom the payment is made, some translations choose not to make explicit the fact that God 'hired' the razor.  For instance, in the Tok Pisin translation (PNG), God simply 'gets' the king of Assyria and uses him like a razor.  If the metaphor 'hired razor' is not understood properly, then an approach similar to that used in Tok Pisin is recommended.

\eval Many translations have 'knowledge of God', and this is adequate as a literal rendering. However, if the target audience would understand it as knowing God as well as the inside of your pocket, it may be advisable to look for a different rendering. What is meant 'with knowledge of God' is knowing what God has done for Israel and knowing how He wants His people to live. This is probably the reason that NJPS has 'obedience to God', but this term should be reserved for other Hebrew words. A better solution to avoid misunderstandings is found in the Gute Nachricht (German): 'nobody knows God and His will'. Another possibility would be: 'people ignore God / what God wants / God's Law'.

\eval The precise translation of this verse is much in debate (see |iTranslator's Handbook|i*, TWAT III, 495 and commentaries on this passage). Some scholars think that the expression דַּעַת טוֹב וָרַע 'knowledge of good and evil', refers to 'knowledge of what is useful or useless for mankind'. That results in a very different translation from 'practical experience of good and evil', or 'knowledge of everything' (whereby 'good and evil' are taken as a summary of totality). In KTBH, 'knowledge of good and evil' is taken as practical experience with the essence of good and evil, and their consequences. But this practical experience does not necessarily mean being personally involved in doing good and evil, because the expression is also used for God (Gen 3:5, 22).Most English versions have 'knowledge of good and evil', which seems pretty general. This has the advantage of not making too clear a choice of what it entails. The CEV (also TEV) rendering ('the other tree... gave the power to know the difference between good and wrong') implies a much clearer choice, but this excludes other interpretations.

In English one would say, respectively, 'an experienced hunter' and 'an experienced sailor'.In his Exodus commentary, U.

\syntagc This Meaning is very close to חָכְמָה 'wisdom'. Several scholars (e.g., TWAT III, 496 think there is no noticable difference in meaning, since both words are often mentioned in one breath. M.V. Fox (|iProverbs 1-9|i*, Anchor Bible Commentary, 32-33) thinks that דַּעַת 'knowledge' is even a more generic term for wisdom than חָכְמָה 'wisdom' is, but he does not make clear what he means. It might be, since חָכְמָה 'wisdom' has 'expertise' as its core meaning, is more functional, i.e. that wisdom conceived as expertise is more often linked to the execution of a particular task, whereas  דַּעַת 'knowledge' focuses more on the faculty itself within the human mind and the way this 'knowledge' originated, not so much on its function for doing things.

\eval The claims made by many scholars that there is no difference in meaning between חָכְמָה 'wisdom' and דַּעַת in its most generic sense, is not reflected in English Bible versions, which all render דַּעַת as 'knowledge'. The German Gute Nachricht, however, has 'Erfahrung' (experience), which is an option to be considered, just as 'insight'. Although 'knowledge' is still a good rendering for many verses listed under this Meaning, there are passages where 'life experience' or 'insight into life' might be preferable. Or even 'wisdom', when דַּעַת appears without its synonym חָכְמָה. In texts like Job 34:25; 35:16 a rendering like 'judgement/understanding' or 'sense' seem to fit the context better than 'knowledge'. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT MATTER. EDCOM INPUT APPRECIATED.

\not (a) The question is here whether דַּעַת עֶלְיוֹן means 'knowledge about the Most High' or 'knowledge that the Most High'. The latter is more probable. Balaam claims that he knows what God knows, i.e. the future. Cf. the commentaries by W.H. Gispen (Commentaar op het Oude Testament) and Y.Z. Moskovitch (Da'at Hamiqra), inter alia.

\not (b) NIV84 renders it 'Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding'. |iWhat|i* do they not understand? The previous verse (Isa 5:12) says that the people of Judah have not paid attention to God's acts and have not 'seen' what the Lord did. This helps us to understand vs 13. The people go into exile because they have no דַּעַת 'knowledge', i.e. they have not understood that things that happened (for example, disasters) were in reality warnings from God. There are also exegetes who link this verse to Hosea 4:6, saying that 'knowledge |iof God|i*' is meant (see REB).

\not (c) If we retain the text here (דַּעַת 'knowledge') and do not change it into רָעוֹת ('evil'), the question is, what kind of knowledge is meant here? The text is a bit mysterious and perhaps is not meant to be crystal-clear. According to Plöger (Kommentar zum AT, 172), דַּעַת 'knowledge' refers to knowledge about the end of times (eschatological knowledge), that will become more widespread in the time of persecution. Aalders (Commentaar op het OT) writes that many people will study the revelations that have been written, and in that way the knowledge (about God's plan) will spread (likewise E. Haag in the Neue Echter Bibel). In both explanations, not a direct 'knowledge of God' is meant, but knowledge about what He has revealed about the future.

\not (d) In this verse, דַּעַת seems independent, i.e. not 'knowledge of/by someone'. One might conclude that it denotes 'knowledge' as acquired through education and study. But this is mistaken. What is meant here is '(human) knowledge of God'. This appears from the context of this chapter and the book of Hosea as a whole (see 4:1; 6:6), but also from 4:6 itself. The prophet says here that the priests have rejected דַּעַת and in one breath he adds that they have forgotten the Law of God. The priests don't teach the Law of God to the people. That is the reason that they are without דַּעַת. They have no knowledge anymore of what God desires in his Law.

\not (f) The construction רוּחַ דַּעַת וְיִרְאַת יהוה 'a spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord' can be explained in two ways: 1. 'a spirit of knowledge, and of fear of the Lord' (i.e. 'knowledge' is absolute, cf. NIV). This interpretation is given by Wildberger in his commentary (BKAT X/1, 449), who claims that 'knowledge' occurs here in the same sense as in wisdom literature, and in Isa 33:6.2. 'a spirit of knowledge |iof the Lord|i* and fear of the Lord' ('knowledge' is linked to the Lord, cf. CEV). The second option is possible in Hebrew, cf. Gesenius-Kautzsch, Hebrew Grammar, §128, note 1). It is followed by the commentaries of Childs and Kissane.Since the parallel occurrence with חָכְמָה 'wisdom' normally signals the first option, we follow that here.

\not (g) This verse is very difficult to interpret. There are almost as many interpretations as there are exegetes. For KTBH, we have taken דַּעַת in its normal sense ('knowledge'). According to Goldingay / Payne (ICC), 325, it harks back to Isa 52:13, where it is said the the Servant 'acts with insight'. We refer translators to |iTranslator's Handbook |i*(forthcoming) for the question what this knowledge is about.

\intro 1. The verb חשׁב denotes different types of mental activity with respect to something or someone. 2. With respect to quantity, it means 'to calculate'.3. With respect to objects, it can mean 'to think about, consider' (Meaning 2). 4. With respect to objects or persons it can denote: having an opinion or judgement about them, and, in a positive sense: to value (Meaning 3). 4. In the framework of crafts, the original meaning has developed into: inventing and designing (Meaning 4). 6. The meaning 'to plan' is a logical extension of the original meaning 'to calculate' with respect to the future (Meaning 5).
\hebraist From the original meaning 'to calculate' the other meanings seem to have developed. However, some scholars presume that the original meaning of this verb is 'to weave' (Jenni/Westermann, Theologisches Woerterbuch zum AT, I, 642), with an appeal to the Exodus passages where the participle חֹושֵׁב is said to mean 'weaver' and the related noun חֵשֶׁב 'waistband'. But in 2Ch 26:5 חֹושֵׁב occurs in the generic sense of 'technician'. If we combine this with the fact that in related languages the cognates of חשׁב do not mean 'to weave' but 'to reckon, calculate', it stands to reason that the latter is the 'original' meaning (cf Gesenius/Donner Hebraeisches und Aramaeisches Handwoerterbuch ad loc.).

\dfnotes The activities denoted by the verb חשׁב and the noun מַחֲשָׁבָה belong to the Wisdom frame. As explained under the entry חָכְמָה ('wisdom', Domain and Frame Notes), wisdom is located in the 'heart', which is the centre of the intellect. So it comes as no surprise that 'planning, calculating, designing and reckoning' are also happening in the לֵב 'heart'. Texts like Exo 35:35; 36:8; 140:3; Pro 16:9 make this connection explicitly with respect to the verb חשׁב.

\stem Piel, Niphal
\gram In this Meaning, חשׁב can be construed with an object and a prepositional phrase (with אֵת or עִם, meaning 'with') denoting the person with whom an account is made. This means that in 2Ki 12:16; 22:7 אֵת does not mark the object, in our opinion, but is a preposition ('with', see also HALOT). Others do take אֵת as an object marker, e.g. SDBH, and consequently attribute a separate Meaning to these two verses ('to require a financial account from someont concerning activities he has undertaken').

\gram This Meaning is often (not always, see Gen 31:15) construed with a preposition that is attached to a noun but in reality functions as shorthand for a predicate clause (see Meaning Comments). Between |hבְּ, כְּ, לְ|h* we found with no detectable difference in meaning. However, the preposition |hעַל|h* designates belonging (see Meaning Comments). The preposition |hעִם|h* (Psa 88:5) denotes the company to whom a person is thought to belong.When the verb is construed with |itwo|i* prepositions, one designates the Event and the other the Benefactive of the Event, e.g. Job 19:11 'He counts me as (|hכְּ|h*) an enemy for (|hלְ|h*) Himself', i.e. 'God thinks: "I [Job] am an enemy for Him".'

Such a predicative clause is an Event, technically speaking.The preposition עַל signals |ibelonging|i*, thus not 'X is Y', but 'X belongs to the category of Y'. For example, 'That city belongs to the territory of Benjamin.'

\stem Qal
\gram The object is sometimes מַחֲשֲׁבֲה 'plan', but as object we also find an object clause (describing an event) introduced by לְ + infinitive construct. A prepositional phrase with עַל 'against' often signals the 'Benefactive', i.e. the one who is to profit or to suffer damage from the plan. (In prophetical books אֶל occurs in the sense of עַל).
\eventfr Agent: human, GodPatient: event, inanimate (plans), implicitBenefactive: human
\syntagc The |iTheologisches Woerterbuch zum AT|i*, III, 247, observes that the Meaning 'to plan' seems to be related to the core meaning of the verb, viz. 'to calculate'. In comparison to the synonyms יעץ and זמם it seems that חשׁב is characterised by 'rational calculation', also with respect to fellow men, and that this explains the often negative intention of 'planning'.

\pos ncf
\gloss design, plan
\freq 56
\intro Although this noun has long been rendered as 'thought' in older versions, it has nothing to do with abstract thinking or philosophy, but rather with practical thinking towards a purpose . It has two Meanings. The first Meaning is 'design', i.e. the result of the imaginative practical thinking of an artist or technician. The second Meaning is 'plan', i.e. practical thinking to put intentions into practice (often bad ones) in the future. The difference of this second Meaning with |hמְזִמָּה|h* is that the latter is more concrete.
\comp 1. Agent: human; patient: inanimate, implicit2. Agent: human, God; patient: event, inanimate, implicit; benefactive: human, implicit
\dfnotes The noun מַחֲשָׁבָה belongs to the Wisdom frame (see also חשׁב, Domain and frame notes)‏. Designs or plans originate in the 'heart' (Gen 6:5; Psa 33:11; Pro 19:21; 6:18; Jer 4:14; 18:12)‏, i.e. in the centre of the rational faculties (English: 'brain')‏. This is because in Hebrew, wisdom is rather intellectual than intuitive (see חָכְמָה, Domain and frame notes)‏. In Israelite society, traditional wisdom was highly valued. It seems that private initiative for one's own benefit was not appreciated, because pursuing one's own private interests is often not good for the community as a whole. 'A "man of plans" is not, as in the Western world, an enterprising fellow who is bound for success, but a schemer' (quote from Domain and Frame notes under מְזִמָּה)‏. It is, therefore, no coincidence, that the noun מַחֲשָׁבָה is often mentioned in one breath with רַע, רָעָה or אָוֶן, all meaning 'evil', sometimes even as near synonyms (Est 8:3; Jer 18:11)‏. So it comes that in Jer 29:11, Yhwh says that He has plans for his people, but immediately adds that these plans are not bad, but good.
\addinfo This word occurs 6x in singular and 50x in plural. In the technical/artistic meaning, singular and plural occur equally often, but the meaning 'plan' occurs almost always in plural. This does not necessarily mean that the text speaks of more than one plan. It may also mean that the mind is thinking |iall the time|i* about its plan or goal, so that the activity is viewed not as a single occurrence, but as a series of activities of the mind.

In 2Ch 26:15 the design is not for decoration, but we are dealing with a cleverly designed machine (for throwing stones), used in the siege of Jerusalem.

This is illustrated by the fact that this noun sometimes stands in poetic parallelism with |hדֶּרֶךְ|h* 'way' or |hמְסִלָּה |h*'path', 'way of life' (Jes 55:7, 8, 8, 9, 9; 59:7).

\sub יעץ
\intro 1. The meanings of this word are all related to a central meaning, ‘to advise, to counsel’ (except Meaning 6, 'wood').2. The relative social status of the people giving and receiving advice helps distinguish the meanings.3. Most commonly it is used where wise people advise other people who are higher in status (Meaning 1).4. Sometimes it denotes the process of social equals conferring together (Meaning 2).5. Sometimes it is used to describe the outcome of deliberation with others or with oneself, i.e. when someone plans what he wants to do in the future (Meaning 3).6. Sometimes it is used when there is only one person involved, who can take counsel with hemself and is able to manage something wisely (Meaning 4).7. It can also denote the character dispostion that is needed for wise management (Meaning 5).

\syntagcc We think that the expression |hהלך בְּעֲצַת פ|h* 'to walk in the counsel of someone' means 'to follow someone's advice'. This becomes clear from 2Ch 22:5, where Ahaziah walks in the counsel of the house of Ahab, i.e. follows their advice to go to war (in Mic 6:16; Psa 81:13; Jer 7:24 we find the same idiom with |hמוֹעֵצָה|h* instead of|h עֵצָה|h*).

\keyverse NJPS - Many designs are in a mans mind, But it is the Lord's |bplan |b*that is accomplished.
\eval The rendering 'plan' is OK, but there are other options. In several poetic parallel lines, two synonyms for 'plan' are used, viz. |hעֵצָה|h* and |hמַחֲשָׁבָה|h* (renderings of the two synonyms separated below by the sign '//'). There are only few versions that use the same term 'plan' twice in this verse (e.g., the Dutch NBV). In many languages it will be more elegant to use different terms for the two words. There are different ways of doing that. We also find 'plans // purpose' (RSV, NIV, NLT), 'schemes // purpose' (REB) in English versions. In parallel verses like this, it is important to find out what the difference between the two synonyms is. Of course the Lord's plan is more fixed and certain than a human plan. Therefore one should also consider a rendering like 'Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but what the Lord has decided will happen.'

In these two verses, 'providence' would seem to be a very good rendering. One could also render: 'Who is this who gives a wrong picture of the way in which I govern/manage/steer the world?'

\not (b) English translations have rendered unanimously 'you guide me with your counsel', whereas some non-English translations have 'you guide me according to your plan/purpose' (Gute Nachricht, NBV). Both are possible, i.e. this verse could also have been listed under Meaning 4. The former suggests that God gives advice to men. Normally advice is given by someone lower in status to someone higher in status. That God is said to give advice (which we also find in Psa 16:7; 32:8 with the verb |hיעץ|h*) means that he, as it were, takes on a low status to persuade people to live according to his will.

\not (c) In Psa 119:24 the expression |hאַנְשֵׁי עֲצָתִי|h* 'men of my counsel' can best be translated as '(your decrees are) my advisors' or '(your decrees are) the ones that give me the best counsel'.

\not (d) For the anomalous form |hעֲצָתַיִךְ|h* in Isa 47:13, see Gesenius / Kautzsch, |iHebrew Grammar|i*, par. 91l. It is a singular form with a (mistaken?) plural suffix. But since the meaning is clearly that the people addressed |ioften|i* obtained advice from soothsayers, it is as well to translate as if it were a regular plural.In this context, |hעֵצָה|h* means 'advice obtained by an oracle or magic'. The verb |hיעץ|h* is also used once in this sense (Num 24:14). See the entry |hיעץ|h* for a discussion of it.

\not (e) Literally it says: 'they rebelled in their deliberation / plan.' A good English rendering is 'they were deliberately rebellious' (NJPS).

\not (f) In this verse, the idea of management is largely absent. The expression |hאֹבַד עֵצוֹת|h* 'lacking (managing) intelligence' merely denotes that Israel's enemies fail to understand that Israel's defeat is not due to their own superiority.
