# This wrapper script starts bibledit and the helper processes.



# The first reasons that made this script necessary was that Gtk got mixed up
# when a child process was repeatedly run.
# Bibledit communicates with BibleTime by very often calling some child 
# processes. It has been noticed in practise that after much use during a day
# of work with Bibledit, the Gtk based graphical functions cease to work.
# Later on git was integrated, and called often.
# Messages have been seen saying that there were too many open files.
# Both the Gtk based graphical functions ceased to work and the child processed 
# failed to be spawned.
# By separating those child processes completely from Bibledit's Gtk, these
# problems disappeared.
# Another reason for using helper programs is that Bibledit got big and 
# sometimes got slower because of the many child processed. 
# By separating these processed this improved too.



# The temporal directory. Create it.
mkdir -p ~/.bibledit_temp



# The log file of bibledit.
# The output of the processes is piped to the logfile.
# The previous logfile is be saved.

# Same story for the log file for bibledit-bibletime
# Bibledit-bibletime needs its own logfile, because if it would write to the
# logfile of bibledit-bin, then they would overwrite each other.

# Start bibledit-bin with all the commandline arguments.
# Using $@ is more useful than $* if both are enclosed within double 
# quotation marks. See the bash manual for reasons.

# Starting bibledit-bin is done in a special way.
# First we see if there is a bibledit-bin in the same directory this script
# was called from. If so, we take that.
# Secondly we see if there is a bibledit-bin in subdirectory src of the 
# parent directory of the directory this script was called from.
# If so we take that one. This facilitates programming Bibledit.
# From the source directory src the programmer can then run ../script/bibledit
# and it will then call ./bibledit-bin in the src directory.
# If none of these were found, then we just take "bibledit-bin", looking in
# the $PATH.
