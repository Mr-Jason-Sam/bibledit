# It has been seen that bibledit crashes when it is started for the first time after rebooting the computer.
# It then exits with code 1.
# It is related to a bug that occurs when gtk is used with threads and with dbus.
# This script runs bibledit, then checks its exit code. 
# If the exit code is 1, it runs it again.
# This script is ugly but I don't care.
# If this script is not needed on Windows, it can be left out.
