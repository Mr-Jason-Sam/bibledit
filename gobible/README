GoBibleCreator

October 2009

The GoBibleCreator is available from http://gobible.jolon.org/
In October 2009 the developer was asked whether the GoBibleCreator could be distributed with Bibledit.
No response has been received yet.
The GoBibleCreator is in the public domain.
On these grounds the program was included with Bibledit.

The following files from the GoBibleCreator zipped package should be included:
GoBibleCore1.jar
GoBibleCore2.jar
GoBibleCreator.jar
ui.properties
