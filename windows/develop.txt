Development occurs on two operating systems:
1. Linux to write the Bibledit library.
2. Windows to write the user interface in Visual Studio Express.
Synchronization through manual copy.

To create a package, Windows uses Inno Setup installed from isetup-5.5.5-unicode.exe.

Library compilation from within a Cygwin shell.

Copy the bibledit.exe and all required .dll files into a location, and run it from there.
