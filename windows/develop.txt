Run script build.sh from a Cygwin terminal to compile the Bibledit library, and to copy the relevant files to C:\bibledit.

Folder gui contains the Bibledit program written in Visual Studio.

To create a package, Windows uses Inno Setup installed from isetup-5.5.5-unicode.exe.
To have a clean package, remove the entire C:\bibledit directory, run the builder, copy bibledit.exe into C:\bibledit, and run the package.iss script.

Notes
* Compiling the bibledit library through Visual Studio resulted in crashes in the library. Compiling in Cygwin works fine.
* The functions "stoi" and "to_string" are not yet available from Cygwin. Work-arounds are in place.
* The Bibledit now starts the server.exe subprocess which runs the bibledit library. When Bibledit were to call the static library created on Cygwin, then a wrapper .dll should be written in C++ in Visual Studio, which calls the static bibledit library. This wrapper can then be called by Bibledit written in C#. A sample wrapper is in folder wrapper.
