Development occurs on two machines:
1. Linux to add Bibledit-Web scripts and update them.
2. Windows to write the app in Visual Studio Express.
Both machines use git for the code.

To create a package, Windows uses Inno Setup installed from isetup-5.5.5-unicode.exe.

For git on Windows, it uses Git-1.9.4-preview20140815.exe with the bash option.

The web server is taken from LightTPD-1.4.35-1-IPv6-Win32-SSL.zip.

PHP is taken from php-5.5.15-nts-Win32-VC11-x86.zip.

Be careful when editing files on Windows with Notepad or another editor.
If the editing causes a byte-order mark (BOM) to be inserted into the script,
PHP notices the BOM in the executed script, and always outputs the BOM.
This causes confusion.
