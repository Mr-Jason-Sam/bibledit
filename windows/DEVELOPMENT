Development occurs on two operating systems:
1. Linux to write the Bibledit library.
2. Windows to write the user interface in Visual Studio Express.
Synchronization through a git repository.

To create a package, Windows uses Inno Setup installed from isetup-5.5.5-unicode.exe.

For git on Windows, it uses Git-1.9.4-preview20140815.exe with the bash option.

Be careful when editing files on Windows with Notepad or another editor.
If the editing causes a byte-order mark (BOM) to be inserted into a script,
this may disrupt the output, and cause confusion.
All text files should be UTF-8 without BOM.
