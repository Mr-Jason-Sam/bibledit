Bibledit-OnlineBible

Bibledit-OnlineBible is a native Windows program.
It acts as an interface between Bibledit and the Online Bible.

Delphi 2010 Professional was used to write the code.

Here are a few simple steps to take to get the programmer up and running:

Create a new application, and save the project as "bibleditonlinebible".

Add a TrayIcon to the form, and set it to visible and set the .ico file to use.
Clicking the tray icon hides or shows the form.

Create a thread for polling Bibledit.
Add a timer to the form, and let it control the polling thread.

Import the Type Library from the Online Bible:
Menu Component / Import Component, then Import Type Library,
select the Online Bible Com Interface, and let it generate a unit.
(A VCL wrapper was not created because I failed to get it to work in Delphi 2010.
If ever the VCL wrappers work, then set the property AutoConnect to False)
