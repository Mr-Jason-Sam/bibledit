The only thing that the manager needs to do at regular times is to 'Send/Receive' the Bible. After having done that, the changes in the Bible, made by the other translators or users, appear on his screen too. And the changes made by himself get stored in the repository, and if the other users do Send/Receive also, then these changes will reflect on their screens also.")</p>
