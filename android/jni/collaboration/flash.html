<h1>translate("Formatting the flash drive")</h1>
<p>translate("Normally a USB flash drive, as it comes out of the box, has been formatted with a FAT filesystem. Such a filesystem is not supported for collaboration. The stick needs to formatted to the ext3 or ext4 filesystem for collaboration to work. How this is done will be described here.")</p>
<p>translate("Insert the flash drive into a computer running GNU/Linux, and wait a little till it gets mounted. It is supposed to mount automatically. If it does not mount on its own, then automatic mounting needs to be set up. Setting up automatic mounting goes beyond the scope of this tutorial.")</p>

<p>translate("To make this flash drive fit for collaboration, there are a few steps to be taken. These steps are:")</p>
<p>translate("1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to make that directory writable. If we assume that the flash drive mounts at /media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called 'repository' is:")</p>
<pre>sudo mkdir /media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p>translate("Notice the ' sudo'  command, which means that this usually needs to be done by user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be denied.")</p>
<p>translate("Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:")</p>
<pre>sudo chmod -R 0777 /media/usbstick/repository/</pre>
<p>translate("Note the 'sudo' again.")</p>
<p>translate("Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is writable. Here's the command:")</p>
<pre>touch /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p>translate("This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be removed again:")</p>
<pre>rm /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p>translate("2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. Type:")</p>
<pre>cd /media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p>translate("3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick.")</p>
<p>translate("To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:")</p>
<pre>git --bare init --shared</pre>
<p>translate("Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created.")</p>
<p>translate("4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's user. To do this, type the following two commands:")</p>
<pre>sudo chown -R $this->username:$this->username *</pre>
<pre>sudo chmod -R 0777 *</pre>
<p>translate("All steps have now been taken. Before removing the flash drive, ensure that the data gets written to it, by issuing the command:")</p>
