-Web depends on a good and stable Android PHP web server.
There are several web server apps available.
Testing determines their stability.

Test 1
Connect to http://192.168.2.1/bibledit-web3.
Download all Bibles, notes and resources from scratch.
Download should happen flawlessly.
The web server should remain responsive after completion.

Test 2
Connect to the production website.
As test 1.

Test 3
Do production work on it for a day.
The web server should remain responsive throughout the day.
