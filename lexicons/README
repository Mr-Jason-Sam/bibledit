Source Language Lexicons


It has a file called "strongsgreek.xml". 
This provides a Strong's Greek dictionary.
It was downloaded from http://files.morphgnt.org/, more specifically from
http://files.morphgnt.org/strongs-dictionary/
The above file seems to have essentially the same data with the Greek lexicon
available from http://ulrikp.dk/strongsgreek/. But the above file was preferred
since it has better markup.


There is a file called "heb_strongs.zip".
It provides a Strong's Hebrew dictionary.
It was downloaded from http://www.walljm.com/misc/heb_strongs.zip.
(The site itself has useful information as well).


It is important for Bibledit that the above names are kept. 
This is because Bibledit looks for these on startup, and creates a combined lexicon database out of them.
