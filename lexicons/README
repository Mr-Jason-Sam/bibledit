Source Language Lexicons


It has a file called "strongsgreek.xml". 
This provides a Strong's Greek dictionary.
It was downloaded from http://files.morphgnt.org/, more specifically from
http://files.morphgnt.org/strongs-dictionary/
The above file seems to have essentially the same data with the Greek lexicon
available from http://ulrikp.dk/strongsgreek/. But the above file was preferred
since it has better markup.


There is a file called "heb_strongs.zip".
It provides a Strong's Hebrew dictionary.
It was downloaded from http://www.walljm.com/misc/heb_strongs.zip.


It is important for Bibledit that the above names are kept. 
This is because Bibledit looks for these on startup, and creates a combined lexicon database out of them.


There is a file called "PARSINGS.TXT".
It provides the parsing codes for the morphological tags as used in the New Testament.
It was downloaded from http://www.byztxt.com.
The file is not used by bibledit itself, but its key was used to write parsing routines.
File sf_robinson_0_eng.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files
contains the same information but in a different form, but may not completely cover all possible parsings.

Update: In October 2009 it was decided that Bibledit should remain lean and clean.
Lexicons and the like are available in other programs as Xiphos and the like.
There's no need to burden Bibledit with it.
Xiphos and the like do a much better job of it than Bibledit would be able to do.
