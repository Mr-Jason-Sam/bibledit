Source Language Lexicons


It has a file called "strongsgreek.xml". 
It has the Strong's Greek dictionary.
It was downloaded from http://files.morphgnt.org/, more specifically from
http://files.morphgnt.org/strongs-dictionary/
The above file seems to have essentially the same data with the Greek lexicon
available from http://ulrikp.dk/strongsgreek/. But the above file was preferred
since it has better markup.



It is important for Bibledit that the above names are kept. 
This is because Bibledit looks for these on startup, and creates a database out of them.
