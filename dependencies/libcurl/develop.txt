libcurl

Libcurl is available from http://curl.haxx.se. The tarball was downloaded, unpacked, and checked-in. This provides the source code to build the libraries for the various operating systems and the various architectures.

iOS

Information about how to build libcurl for iOS, and how to use it in an iOS app, is available from http://seiryu.home.comcast.net/~seiryu/libcurl-ios.html. A software archive is available from there too. It provides the script “build-libcurl-ios.sh” to build the library on iOS. The ios folder contains the “build” script. Run it like this:
$ ./build.sh
It generates libcurl.a, and the headers in the curl directory, on the Desktop. Copy these to ios/include and ios/lib so the iOS builder for the bibledit library can find them. Include the library with with Bibledit for iOS.
