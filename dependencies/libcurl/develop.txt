libcurl

Libcurl is available from http://curl.haxx.se. The tarball was downloaded, unpacked, and checked-in. This provides the source code to build the libraries for the various operating systems and the various architectures.

iOS

Information about how to build libcurl for iOS, and how to use it in an iOS app, is available from http://seiryu.home.comcast.net/~seiryu/libcurl-ios.html. A software archive is available from there too. It comes with a precompiled binary of libcurl, its headers, and a sample app for iOS developers. It also provides the build script to build the library on iOS. The iOS folder in this repository contains the build script, the headers, and the precompiled library copied from this archive.
