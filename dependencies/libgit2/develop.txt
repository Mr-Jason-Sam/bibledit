libgit2

Libgit2 is available from https://libgit2.github.com. Version 0.21.5 was downloaded as a tarsal, then unpacked. To save space, the “tests” folder was removed. The remainder was checked-in. This provides the source code to build the library for the various operating systems and the various architectures. Libgit2 is developing fast, and the API is not yet stable. Bibledit works with the API of version 0.21.
