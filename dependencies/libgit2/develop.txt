libgit2

Libgit2 is available from https://libgit2.github.com. Version 0.21.5 was downloaded as a tarball, then unpacked, then checked-in. This provides the source code to build the library for the various operating systems and the various architectures. Libgit2 is developing fast, and the API is not yet stable. Bibledit works with the API of version 0.21.

OS X

Information about building for OS X is at https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link. Run the “build” script in the osx folder. Copy the files libgit2.a and git2.h and folder git2 to the ../dependencies/libgit2 folder. The ./configure script of the Bibledit library will then find them. 

iOS

Information about building for OS X is at https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link and at https://github.com/Eonil/libgit2-make-ios.
