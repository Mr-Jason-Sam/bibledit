libgit2

Libgit2 is available from https://libgit2.github.com. Version 0.21.5 was downloaded as a tarball, then unpacked, then checked-in. This provides the source code to build the library for the various operating systems and the various architectures. Libgit2 is developing fast, and the API is not yet stable. Bibledit works with the API of version 0.21.

OS X

Information about building for OS X is at https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link. Building works through the autotools. Run the “build” script in the auto folder. It will copy the files libgit2.a and git2.h and folder git2 to the auto folder. When configurating Bibledit, reference this folder through the ./configure script. 

Linux

Build through the autotools. See OS X for more information.

Cygwin

Build through the autotools. See OS X for more information.

iOS

Information about building for OS X is at https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link and at https://github.com/Eonil/libgit2-make-ios. Bibledit uses libgit2 for some of the git operations, and uses the command line version of git for other git operations. The command line tool does not work on iOS. Therefore it is not yet possible now to use the git operations on iOS. For that reason is is not yet necessary to compile libgit2 for iOS.

Android

See iOS for reasons Bibledit does not yet use git on Android.
