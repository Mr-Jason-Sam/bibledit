\ms1 Jesus is alive
\s1 Jesus is alive
\r (Matthew 28.1-8; Luke 24.1-12; John 20.1-10)
\p
\v 1 After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James bought some spices to put on Jesus' body.
\v 2 Very early on Sunday morning, just as the sun was coming up, they went to the tomb.
\v 3 On their way, they were asking one another, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance for us?”
\v 4 But when they looked, they saw that the stone had already been rolled away. And it was a huge stone!
\p
\v 5 The women went into the tomb, and on the right side they saw a young man in a white robe sitting there. They were alarmed.
\p
\v 6 The man said, “Don't be alarmed! You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was nailed to a cross. God has raised him to life, and he isn't here. You can see the place where they put his body.
\v 7 Now go and tell his disciples, and especially Peter, that he will go ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”\x - \xo 16.7: \xt Mt 26.32; Mk 14.28.\x*
\p
\v 8 When the women ran from the tomb, they were confused and shaking all over. They were too afraid to tell anyone what had happened.

\ms1 Jesus appears to his followers
\s1 Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene
\r (Matthew 28.9,10; John 20.11-18)
\p
\v 9 Very early on the first day of the week, after Jesus had risen to life, he appeared to Mary Magdalene. Earlier he had forced seven demons out of her.
\v 10 She left and told his friends, who were crying and mourning.
\v 11 Even though they heard that Jesus was alive and that Mary had seen him, they would not believe it.
\s1 Jesus appears to two disciples
\r (Luke 24.13-35)
\p
\v 12 Later, Jesus appeared in another form to two disciples, as they were on their way out of the city.
\v 13 But when these disciples told what had happened, the others would not believe.
\s1 What Jesus' followers must do
\r (Matthew 28.16-20; Luke 24.36-49; John 20.19-23; Acts 1.6-8)
\p
\v 14 Afterwards, Jesus appeared to his eleven disciples as they were eating. He scolded them because they were too stubborn to believe the ones who had seen him after he had been raised to life.
\v 15 Then he told them:\x - \xo 16.15: \xt Ac 1.8.\x*
\pi Go and preach the good news to everyone in the world.
\v 16 Anyone who believes me and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe me will be condemned.
\v 17 Everyone who believes me will be able to do wonderful things. By using my name they will force out demons, and they will speak new languages.
\v 18 They will handle snakes and will drink poison and not be hurt. They will also heal sick people by placing their hands on them.
\s1 Jesus returns to heaven
\r (Luke 24.50-53; Acts 1.9-11)
\p
\v 19 After the Lord Jesus had said these things to the disciples, he was taken back up to heaven where he sat down at the right side\f + \fr 16.19 \fq right side: \ft See the note at 12.36.\f* of God.\x - \xo 16.19: \xt Ac 1.9-11.\x*
\v 20 Then the disciples left and preached everywhere. The Lord was with them, and the miracles they performed proved that their message was true.

\vp* The women quickly told Peter and his friends what had happened. Later, Jesus sent the disciples to the east and to the west with his sacred and everlasting message of how people can be saved for ever.
