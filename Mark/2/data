\s1 Jesus heals a crippled man
\r (Matthew 9.1-8; Luke 5.17-26)
\p
\v 1 Jesus went back to Capernaum, and a few days later people heard that he was at home.\fe * \fr 2.1 \fq at home: \ft Or “in the house” (perhaps Simon Peter's home).\fe*
\v 2 Then so many of them came to the house that there wasn't even standing room left in front of the door.
\p Jesus was still teaching
\v 3 when four people came up, carrying a crippled man on a mat.
\v 4 But because of the crowd, they could not get him to Jesus. So they made a hole in the roof\f + \fr 2.4 \fq roof: \ft In Palestine the houses usually had a flat roof. Stairs on the outside led up to the roof that was made of beams and boards covered with packed earth.\f* above him and let the man down in front of everyone.
\p
\v 5 When Jesus saw how much faith they had, he said to the crippled man, “My friend, your sins are forgiven.”
\p
\v 6 Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were sitting there. They started wondering,
\v 7 “Why would he say such a thing? He must think he is God! Only God can forgive sins.”
\p
\v 8 Straight away, Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, “Why are you thinking such things?
\v 9 Is it easier for me to tell this crippled man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home?
\v 10 I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth.” So Jesus said to the man,
\v 11 “Get up! Pick up your mat and go on home.”
\p
\v 12 The man got straight up. He picked up his mat and went out while everyone watched in amazement. They praised God and said, “We have never seen anything like this!”
\s1 Jesus chooses Levi
\r (Matthew 9.9-13; Luke 5.27-32)
\p
\v 13 Once again, Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
\v 14 As he walked along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the place for paying taxes, and Jesus said to him, “Come with me!” So he got up and went with Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Later, Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi's house.\fe * \fr 2.15 \fq Levi's house: \ft Or “Jesus' house”.\fe* Many tax collectors\f + \fr 2.15 \fq tax collectors: \ft These were usually Jewish people who paid the Romans for the right to collect taxes. They were hated by other Jews who thought of them as traitors to their country and to their religion.\f* and other sinners had become followers of Jesus, and they were also guests at the dinner.
\p
\v 16 Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees, and they saw that Jesus was eating with sinners and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
\p
\v 17 Jesus heard them and answered, “Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do. I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers. I came to invite sinners.”
\s1 People ask about going without eating
\r (Matthew 9.14-17; Luke 5.33-39)
\p
\v 18 The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating.\f + \fr 2.18 \fq without eating: \ft The Jewish people sometimes went without eating (also called “fasting”) to show their love for God or to show sorrow for their sins.\f* Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do the followers of John and those of the Pharisees often go without eating, while your disciples never do?”
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered:
\pi The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them.
\v 20 But the time will come when he will be taken from them. Then they will go without eating.
\pi
\v 21 No one patches old clothes by sewing on a piece of new cloth. The new piece would shrink and tear a bigger hole.
\pi
\v 22 No one pours new wine into old wineskins. The wine would swell and burst the old skins.\f + \fr 2.22 \fq swell and burst the old skins: \ft While the juice from grapes was becoming wine, it would swell and stretch the skins in which it had been stored. If the skins were old and stiff, they would burst.\f* Then the wine would be lost, and the skins would be ruined. New wine must be put into new wineskins.
\s1 A question about the Sabbath
\r (Matthew 12.1-8; Luke 6.1-5)
\p
\v 23 One Sabbath Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields. His disciples were picking grains of wheat as they went along.\f + \fr 2.23 \fq went along: \ft It was the custom to let hungry travellers pick grains of wheat.\f*\x - \xo 2.23: \xt Dt 23.25.\x*
\v 24 Some Pharisees asked Jesus, “Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath? They are not supposed to do that!”
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered, “Haven't you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need?\x - \xo 2.25-26: \xt 1 S 21.1-6.\x*
\v 26 It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his followers.”\x - \xo 2.26: \xt Lv 24.9.\x*
\p
\v 27 Jesus finished by saying, “People were not made for the good of the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for the good of people.
\v 28 So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.”
