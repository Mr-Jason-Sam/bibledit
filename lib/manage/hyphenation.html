<p>translate("Hyphenation can be used when preparing a Bible for printing.") ?></p>
<p>translate("It allows for more efficient usage of paper, and for more regular appearance of margins at the end of the lines without requiring spacing adjustments.") ?></p>
<p>translate("The details of hyphenating properly are complex and dependent on the language, and can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices.") ?></p>
<p>translate("Hyphenation may not be so important when preparing a Bible for proofreading. It is usually regarded important for production quality Bibles.") ?></p>
<br>
<p>translate("When preparing a Bible in LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, en so on, the wordprocessor itself provides hyphenation algorithms for many languages.") ?></p>
<p>translate("If no suitable hyphenation algorithm can be used, perhaps Bibledit can assist to a limited degree.") ?></p>

<p>translate("The wordprocessor sees these soft hyphens. When a soft hyphen occurs near the end of the line, it breaks the word there.") ?></p>

<p>translate("Bibledit has one hyphenating algorithm. When there is a transition in the text from any character of a first set of characters, to any character of a second set of characters, then the soft hyphen will be inserted at that location in the text.") ?></p>
