<p>gettext("The next role is Translator. These are the ones that have all the rights of the Consultant, but in addition can change the Bible text.")</p>
<p>gettext("Then there's the Manager. The manager has all the privileges of the previous levels, but in addition can add books to the Bible, delete books, add chapters, copy Bibles, and so on. The manager can assign privileges to the translators, consultants, and so on.")</p>

<p>gettext("Everybody who has an account can enable the personal notifications. Those who have switched the relevant notifications on can receive email from Bibledit.

They can also get automatic daily email detailing the changes that have been made in the Bible since the previous email.")</p>
<br>
<p>gettext("Everybody who has an account can create consultation notes by email, and respond to these by email.")</p>
