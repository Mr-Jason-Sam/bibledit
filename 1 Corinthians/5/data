\v 1 I have heard terrible things about some of you. In fact, you are behaving worse than the Gentiles. A man is even sleeping with his own stepmother.\fe * \fr 5.1 \fq is even sleeping with his own stepmother: \ft Or “has even married his own stepmother.”\fe*\x - \xo 5.1: \xt Dt 22.30.\x*
\v 2 You are proud, when you ought to feel bad enough to chase away anyone who acts like that.
\p
\v 3-4 I am with you only in my thoughts. But in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already judged this man, as though I were with you in person. So when you meet together and the power of the Lord Jesus is with you, I will be there too.
\v 5 You must then hand that man over to Satan. His body will be destroyed, but his spirit will be saved when the Lord Jesus returns.

\v 6 Stop being proud! Don't you know how a little yeast can spread through the whole batch of dough?\x - \xo 5.6: \xt Ga 5.9.\x*
\v 7 Get rid of the old yeast! Then you will be like fresh bread made without yeast, and that is what you are. Our Passover lamb is Christ, who has already been sacrificed.\x - \xo 5.7: \xt Ex 12.5.\x*
\v 8 So don't celebrate the festival by being evil and sinful, which is like serving bread made with yeast. Be pure and truthful and celebrate by using bread made without yeast.\x - \xo 5.8: \xt Ex 13.7; Dt 16.3.\x*

\v 9 In my other letter\f + \fr 5.9 \fq other letter: \ft An unknown letter that Paul wrote to the Christians at Corinth before he wrote this one.\f* I told you not to have anything to do with immoral people.
\v 10 But I wasn't talking about the people of this world. You would have to leave this world to get away from everyone who is immoral or greedy or who cheats or worships idols.
\v 11 I was talking about your own people who are immoral or greedy or worship idols or curse others or get drunk or cheat. Don't even eat with them!
\v 12 Why should I judge outsiders? Aren't we supposed to judge only church members?
\v 13 God judges everyone else. The Scriptures say, “Chase away any of your own people who are evil.”\x - \xo 5.13: \xt Dt 13.5; 17.7 (LXX).\x*
