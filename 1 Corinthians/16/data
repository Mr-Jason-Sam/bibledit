\ms1 An offering for the poor
\s1 A collection for God's people
\p
\v 1 When you collect money for God's people, I want you to do exactly what I told the churches in Galatia to do.\x - \xo 16.1: \xt Ro 15.25,26.\x*
\v 2 That is, each Sunday each of you must put aside part of what you have earned. If you do this, you won't have to take up a collection when I come.
\v 3 Choose some followers to take the money to Jerusalem. I will send them on with the money and with letters which show that you approve of them.
\v 4 If you think I should go along, they can go with me.
\ms1 Paul's travel plans
\p
\v 5 After I have gone through Macedonia, I hope to see you\x - \xo 16.5: \xt Ac 19.21.\x*
\v 6 and stay with you for a while. I may even stay all winter, so that you can help me on my way to wherever I will be going next.
\v 7 If the Lord lets me, I would rather come later for a longer visit than to stop off now for only a short visit.
\v 8 I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,\x - \xo 16.8: \xt Lv 23.15-21; Dt 16.9-11.\x*\x - \xo 16.8,9: \xt Ac 19.8-10.\x*
\v 9 because there is a wonderful opportunity for me to do some work here. But there are also many people who are against me.
\p
\v 10 When Timothy arrives, give him a friendly welcome. He is doing the Lord's work, just as I am.\x - \xo 16.10: \xt 1 Co 4.17.\x*
\v 11 Don't let anyone ill-treat him. I am looking for him to return to me together with the other followers. So when he leaves, send him off with your blessings.
\p
\v 12 I have tried hard to get our friend Apollos to visit you with the other followers. He doesn't want to come just now, but he will come when he can.
\ms1 Personal concerns and greetings
\p
\v 13 Keep alert. Be firm in your faith. Stay brave and strong.
\v 14 Show love in everything you do.
\p
\v 15 You know that Stephanas and his family were the first in Achaia to have faith in the Lord. They have done all they can for God's people. My friends, I ask you\x - \xo 16.15: \xt 1 Co 1.16.\x*
\v 16 to obey leaders like them and to do the same for all others who work hard with you.
\p
\v 17 I was glad to see Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. Having them here was like having you.
\v 18 They made me feel much better, just as they made you feel better. You should appreciate people like them.
\p
\v 19 Greetings from the churches in Asia.\x - \xo 16.19: \xt Ac 18.2.\x*
\p Aquila and Priscilla, together with the church that meets in their house, send greetings in the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 20 All the Lord's followers send their greetings.
\p Give each other a warm greeting.
\p
\v 21 I am signing this letter myself: PAUL.
\p
\v 22 I pray that God will put a curse on everyone who doesn't love the Lord. And may the Lord come soon.
\p
\v 23 I pray that the Lord Jesus will be kind to you.
\p
\v 24 I love everyone who belongs to Christ Jesus.
