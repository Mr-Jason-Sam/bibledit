\c 13
\s1 Love
\q1
\v 1 What if I could speak
\q1 all languages of humans
\q2 and of angels?
\q1 If I did not love others,
\q2 I would be nothing more
\q1 than a noisy gong
\q2 or a clanging cymbal.
\q1
\v 2 What if I could prophesy\x - \xo 13.2: \xt Mt 17.20; 21.21; Mk 11.23.\x*
\q1 and understand all secrets
\q2 and all knowledge?
\q1 And what if I had faith
\q2 that moved mountains?
\q1 I would be nothing,
\q2 unless I loved others.
\q1
\v 3 What if I gave away all
\q2 that I owned
\q1 and let myself
\q2 be burnt alive?\fe * \fr 13.3 \fq and let myself be burnt alive: \ft Some manuscripts have “so that I could boast.”\fe*
\q1 I would gain nothing,
\q2 unless I loved others.
\q1
\v 4 Love is kind and patient,
\q1 never jealous, boastful,
\q2 proud, or
\v 5 rude.
\q1 Love isn't selfish
\q2 or quick-tempered.
\q1 It doesn't keep a record
\q2 of wrongs that others do.
\q1
\v 6 Love rejoices in the truth,
\q2 but not in evil.
\q1
\v 7 Love is always supportive,
\q1 loyal, hopeful,
\q2 and trusting.
\q1
\v 8 Love never fails!
\b
\q1 Everyone who prophesies
\q2 will stop,
\q1 and unknown languages
\q1 will no longer
\q2 be spoken.
\q1 All that we know
\q2 will be forgotten.
\q1
\v 9 We don't know everything,
\q1 and our prophecies
\q2 are not complete.
\q1
\v 10 But what is perfect
\q2 will some day appear,
\q1 and what isn't perfect
\q2 will then disappear.
\b
\q1
\v 11 When we were children,
\q1 we thought and reasoned
\q2 as children do.
\q1 But when we grew up,
\q2 we stopped our childish ways.
\q1
\v 12 Now all we can see of God
\q1 is like a cloudy picture
\q2 in a mirror.
\q1 Later we will see him
\q2 face to face.
\q1 We don't know everything,
\q2 but then we will,
\q1 just as God completely
\q2 understands us.
\q1
\v 13 For now there are faith,
\q2 hope, and love.
\q1 But of these three,
\q2 the greatest is love.
