\ms1 Guidance for worship and church life
\s1 Rules for worship
\p
\v 2 I am proud of you, because you always remember me and obey the teachings I gave you.
\v 3 Now I want you to know that Christ is the head over all men, and a man is the head over a woman. But God is the head over Christ.
\v 4 This means that any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head brings shame to his head.
\p
\v 5 But any woman who prays or prophesies without something on her head brings shame to her head. In fact, she may as well shave her head.\f + \fr 11.5 \fq she may as well shave her head: \ft A woman's hair was a mark of beauty, and it was shameful for a woman to cut her hair short or to shave her head, so that she looked like a man.\f*
\v 6 A woman should wear something on her head. It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair. But if she refuses to wear something on her head, let her cut off her hair.
\p
\v 7 Men were created to be like God and to bring honour to God. This means that a man should not wear anything on his head. Women were created to bring honour to men.\x - \xo 11.7: \xt Gn 1.26,27.\x*
\v 8 It was the woman who was made from a man, and not the man who was made from a woman.\x - \xo 11.8,9: \xt Gn 2.18-23.\x*
\v 9 He wasn't created for her. She was created for him.
\v 10 And so, because of this, and also because of the angels, a woman ought to wear something on her head, as a sign of her authority.\f + \fr 11.10 \fq as a sign of her authority: \ft Or “as a sign that she is under someone's authority.”\f*
\p
\v 11 As far as the Lord is concerned, men and women need each other.
\v 12 It is true that the first woman came from a man, but all other men have been given birth by women. Yet God is the one who created everything.
\v 13 Ask yourselves if it is proper for a woman to pray without something on her head.
\v 14 Isn't it unnatural and disgraceful for men to have long hair?
\v 15 But long hair is a beautiful way for a woman to cover her head.
\v 16 This is how things are done in all God's churches,\fe * \fr 11.16 \fq This is how things are done in all God's churches: \ft Or “There is no set rule for this in any of God's churches.”\fe* and that's why none of you should argue about what I have said.
\s1 Rules for the Lord's Supper
\p
\v 17 Your worship services do you more harm than good. I am certainly not going to praise you for this.
\v 18 I am told that you can't get along with each other when you worship, and I am sure that some of what I have heard is true.
\v 19 You are bound to argue with each other, but it is easy to see which of you have God's approval.
\p
\v 20 When you meet together, you don't really celebrate the Lord's Supper.
\v 21 You even start eating before everyone gets to the meeting, and some of you go hungry, while others get drunk.
\v 22 Don't you have homes where you can eat and drink? Do you hate God's church? Do you want to embarrass people who don't have anything? What can I say to you? I certainly cannot praise you.
\s1 The Lord's Supper
\r (Matthew 26.26-29; Mark 14.22-25; Luke 22.14-20)
\p
\v 23 I have already told you what the Lord Jesus did on the night he was betrayed. And it came from the Lord himself.
\pi He took some bread in his hands.
\v 24 Then after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Eat this and remember me.”
\pi
\v 25 After the meal, Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and said, “This is my blood, and with it God makes his new agreement with you. Drink this and remember me.”\x - \xo 11.25: a \xt Ex 24.8; Jr 31.31-34; \xo b \xt Ex 24.6-8.\x*
\p
\v 26 The Lord meant that when you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you tell about his death until he comes.
\p
\v 27 But if you eat the bread and drink the wine in a way that isn't worthy of the Lord, you sin against his body and blood.
\v 28 That's why you must examine the way you eat and drink.
\v 29 If you fail to understand that you are the body of the Lord, you will condemn yourselves by the way you eat and drink.
\v 30 That's why many of you are sick and weak and why a lot of others have died.
\v 31 If we carefully judge ourselves, we won't be punished.
\v 32 But when the Lord judges and punishes us, he does it to keep us from being condemned with the rest of the world.
\p
\v 33 My dear friends, you should wait until everyone gets there before you start eating.
\v 34 If you really are hungry, you can eat at home. Then you won't condemn yourselves when you meet together.
\p After I arrive, I will instruct you about the other matters.
