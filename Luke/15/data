\s1 One sheep
\r (Matthew 18.12-14)
\p
\v 1 Tax collectors\f + \fr 15.1 \fq Tax collectors: \ft See the note at 3.12.\f* and sinners were all crowding around to listen to Jesus.\x - \xo 15.1,2: \xt Lk 5.29,30.\x*
\v 2 So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses started grumbling, “This man is friendly with sinners. He even eats with them.”
\p
\v 3 Then Jesus told them this story:
\pi
\v 4 If any of you has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, what will you do? Won't you leave the ninety-nine in the field and go and look for the lost sheep until you find it?
\v 5 And when you find it, you will be so glad that you will put it on your shoulder
\v 6 and carry it home. Then you will call in your friends and neighbours and say, “Let's celebrate! I've found my lost sheep.”
\p
\v 7 Jesus said, “In the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over ninety-nine good people who don't need to.”
\s1 One coin
\p
\v 8 Jesus told the people another story:
\pi What will a woman do if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them? Won't she light a lamp, sweep the floor, and look carefully until she finds it?
\v 9 Then she will call in her friends and neighbours and say, “Let's celebrate! I've found the coin I lost.”
\p
\v 10 Jesus said, “In the same way God's angels are happy when even one person turns to him.”
\s1 Two sons
\p
\v 11 Jesus also told them another story:
\pi Once a man had two sons.
\v 12 The younger son said to his father, “Give me my share of the property.” So the father divided his property between his two sons.
\pi
\v 13 Not long after that, the younger son packed up everything he owned and left for a foreign country, where he wasted all his money in wild living.
\v 14 He had spent everything, when a bad famine spread through that whole land. Soon he had nothing to eat.
\pi
\v 15 He went to work for a man in that country, and the man sent him out to take care of his pigs.\f + \fr 15.15 \fq pigs: \ft The Jewish religion taught that pigs were not fit to eat or even to touch. A Jewish man would have felt terribly insulted if he had to feed pigs, much less eat with them.\f*
\v 16 He would have been glad to eat what the pigs were eating,\f + \fr 15.16 \fq what the pigs were eating: \ft The Greek text has “(bean) pods”, which came from a tree in Palestine. These were used to feed animals. Poor people sometimes ate them too.\f* but no one gave him a thing.
\pi
\v 17 Finally, he came to his senses and said, “My father's workers have plenty to eat, and here I am, starving to death!
\v 18 I will go to my father and say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against God in heaven and against you.
\v 19 I am no longer good enough to be called your son. Treat me like one of your workers.’ ”
\pi
\v 20 The younger son got up and started back to his father. But when he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son and hugged and kissed him.
\pi
\v 21 The son said, “Father, I have sinned against God in heaven and against you. I am no longer good enough to be called your son.”
\pi
\v 22 But his father said to the servants, “Hurry and bring the best clothes and put them on him. Give him a ring for his finger and sandals\f + \fr 15.22 \fq ring...sandals: \ft These show that the young man's father fully accepted him as his son. A ring was a sign of high position in the family. Sandals showed that he was a son instead of a slave, since slaves did not usually wear sandals.\f* for his feet.
\v 23 Get the best calf and prepare it, so we can eat and celebrate.
\v 24 This son of mine was dead, but has now come back to life. He was lost and has now been found.” And they began to celebrate.
\pi
\v 25 The elder son had been out in the field. But when he came near the house, he heard the music and dancing.
\v 26 So he called one of the servants over and asked, “What's going on here?”
\pi
\v 27 The servant answered, “Your brother has come home safe and sound, and your father ordered us to kill the best calf.”
\v 28 The elder brother got so angry that he would not even go into the house.
\pi His father came out and begged him to go in.
\v 29 But he said to his father, “For years I have worked for you like a slave and have always obeyed you. But you have never even given me a little goat, so that I could give a dinner for my friends.
\v 30 This other son of yours wasted your money on prostitutes. And now that he has come home, you ordered the best calf to be killed for a feast.”
\pi
\v 31 His father replied, “My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
\v 32 But we should be glad and celebrate! Your brother was dead, but he is now alive. He was lost and has now been found.”
