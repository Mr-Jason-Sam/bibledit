\p At that time God spoke to Zechariah's son John, who was living in the desert.
\v 3 So John went along the Jordan Valley, telling the people, “Turn back to God and be baptized! Then your sins will be forgiven.”
\v 4 Isaiah the prophet wrote about John when he said,\x - \xo 3.4-6: \xt Is 40.3-5 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “In the desert
\q2 someone is shouting,
\q1 ‘Get the road ready
\q2 for the Lord!
\q1 Make a straight path
\q2 for him.
\q1
\v 5 Fill up every valley
\q1 and level every mountain
\q2 and hill.
\q1 Straighten the crooked paths
\q1 and smooth out
\q2 the rough roads.
\q1
\v 6 Then everyone will see
\q2 the saving power of God.’ ”
\p
\v 7 Crowds of people came out to be baptized, but John said to them, “You snakes! Who warned you to run from the coming judgment?\x - \xo 3.7: \xt Mt 12.34; 23.33.\x*
\v 8 Do something to show that you really have given up your sins. Don't start saying that you belong to Abraham's family.

\v 10 The crowds asked John, “What should we do?”

\v 11 John told them, “If you have two coats, give one to someone who doesn't have any. If you have food, share it with someone else.”
\p
\v 12 When tax collectors\f + \fr 3.12 \fq tax collectors: \ft These were usually Jewish people who paid the Romans for the right to collect taxes. They were hated by other Jews who thought of them as traitors to their country and to their religion.\f* came to be baptized, they asked John, “Teacher, what should we do?”\x - \xo 3.12: \xt Lk 7.29.\x*
\p
\v 13 John told them, “Don't make people pay more than they owe.”
\p
\v 14 Some soldiers asked him, “And what about us? What do we have to do?”
\p John told them, “Don't force people to pay money to make you leave them alone. Be satisfied with your pay.”
\p
\v 15 Everyone became excited and wondered, “Could John be the Messiah?”
\p
\v 16 John said, “I am just baptizing with water. But someone more powerful is going to come, and I am not good enough even to untie his sandals.\f + \fr 3.16 \fq untie his sandals: \ft This was the duty of a slave.\f* He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

He will store the wheat in his barn and burn the husks with a fire that never goes out.”
\p
\v 18 In many different ways John preached the good news to the people.
\v 19 But to Herod the ruler, he said, “It was wrong for you to take Herodias, your brother's wife.” John also said that Herod had done many other bad things.\x - \xo 3.19,20: \xt Mt 14.3,4; Mk 6.17,18.\x*
