The ptx2pdf macros are held in a Subversion (version control) repository. You can access this in several ways:

(a) With a web browser, go to http://scripts.sil.org/svn-view/sfscripture/TRUNK/ptx2pdf/ 

(b) At that page, click the "Download tarball" link

(c) Or check out a copy: svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/sfscripture/TRUNK/ptx2pdf

(There is also ptxplus at "hg clone http://hg.palaso.org/ptxplus". It should do a little more than ptx2pdf).
