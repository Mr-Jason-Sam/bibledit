<h2><a name="usfm"></a>USFM</h2>

<p>Information about Unified Standard Format Markers (USFM) is available from
the Bibledit menu. Click Help, and then USFM. A new window will open that
displays the official USFM information.</p>

<p>Bibledit supports several of the markers.</p>

<p>By editing the stylesheet of a project, the number of supported markers can
be extended. Completely new markers can be added too, but this is not
recommended. It is recommended to stick to the USFM standard. A style can be
edited by opening a stylesheet, then switching the Edit mode on, and then
editing that style.</p>
