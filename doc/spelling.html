<h2><a name="spelling"></a>Spelling</h2>

<p>Bibledit includes a spelling checker. If a word is misspelled, it will be
underlined in red. If the user clicks on that word with the right button of the
mouse, a menu appears that allows the user to handle this word. </p>

<p>This is basically all what it involves. A more detailed description follows
below.</p>

<p>Spelling checking is switched on or off in the <a
href="olh_project_properties.html">Project properties dialog</a>. If "Check
spelling" is ticked, then the spell checker is switched on, else it is off.
When switching the spelling checker on, and if there are no dictionaries added
yet to use, then naturally all words are misspelled. </p>

<p>Adding dictionaries is done in the same dialog. Button "Dictionaries" gives
access to all available dictionaries on the system. If that button is clicked,
then a dialog "Dictionaries" opens. <a href="olh_dictionaries.html">More help
is available about this</a>.</p>

<p>If a word is misspelled, and the user clicks on it with the right button of
the mouse, then a menu with Spelling suggestions opens. These give possible
corrections for the word. If one such suggestion is chosen, then the word will
be replaced with that suggestions. It also is possible to add the misspelled
word to the dictionary. It will be added to the first editable <a
href="olh_dictionaries.html">dictionary in the list of dictionaries</a>.
Another option is to Ignore all. This means that for this session the
misspelled word is ignored.</p>

<p>Notes. </p>

<p>1. There is some information about how <a
href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97545">apostrophes in e.g.
"it's" are handled</a>.</p>

<p>2. The Check menu allows the user to go to the next or to the previous
spelling error. If the user does this, the cursor will move to another spelling
error. If there are no more spelling errors to go to, it will go to another
chapter.</p>
