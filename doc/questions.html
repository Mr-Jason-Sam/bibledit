<h3><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h3>

<h4><a name="commandlineinstructionsgiveerrors"></a>Commandline instructions
give errors</h4>

<p>I ran the command line instructions, but got errors - can you help me
understand what I did wrong?</p>
<pre>Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600] (C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.
C:\Documents and Settings\User&gt; cd "C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\My Downloads\scricheck-0.2.9"
C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\My Downloads\bibledit-1.6&gt;
./configure '.' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</pre>

<p>Reply: When installing it on Windows, install Cygwin first. See <a
href="install_bibledit_windows.html">Bibledit's Windows installation
instructions</a>. Then execute all commands from within the Cygwin
terminal.</p>

<h4><a name="thereisnoacceptableccompilerinpath"></a>There is no acceptable C
compiler in $path</h4>

<p>This happens when you did not install a C compiler.Installing Bibledit
from source requires a C compiler. This compiler is part of development
tools. The installation instructions for Linux, or for Macintosh, or Windows,
give instructions on how to install such development tools. If you follow
these instructions, the problem will be gone. For example, on Windows, you
need to install package "gcc" in Cygwin.</p>

<h4><a name="doeswinerunaprogramthatisalreadyonmywindowspartition"></a>Does
Wine run a program that is already on my Windows partition?</h4>

<p>Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Let's say to run the Outpost, normally you would type</p>
<pre>wine "c:\Program Files\Bibledit Windows Outpost\bwoutpost.exe"</pre>

<p>If the Outpost is already installed on your Windows partition in a
dual-boot system, you could type, for example</p>
<pre>wine "/windows/c/Program Files/Bibledit Windows Outpost/bwoutpost.exe"</pre>

<p>The "windows/c" part depends on your configuration.</p>

<h4><a name="problemwhenoutpostrunsonanotherhost"></a>Problem when Outpost
runs on another host</h4>

<p>Q. When setting up the Outpost to run on another host, in the settings
dialog, when I type in the name of the host, I get this error message: Host
&lt;name&gt; cannot be contacted through the network.</p>

<p>A. Points to check:</p>

<p>1. Is the hostname you are entering the one set in Windows on the other
host?</p>

<p>2. Try finding out Windows' IP address, and then pinging it from Linux. If
that works, enter that IP number in the Outpost Setup dialog.</p>

<p>3. If the IP number changes continually, enter a static IP number in
Windows.</p>

<p>4. Is the Outpost installed and running in Windows? It has to be started
manually, because Bibledit can't start it over the network.</p>

<p>5. Be sure that the Windows firewall does not block port 51515 for
incoming connections.</p>

<p>6. Be sure that you have typed the right IP number. It can be checked by
opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and typing "ipconfig". The IP number
assigned to the network should correspond with the one you entered.</p>

<h3><a name="general"></a>General</h3>

<h4><a name="thelogsayscriticaldatabasediskimageismalformed"></a>The log
says: CRITICAL **: database disk image is malformed</h4>

<p>This message can be either from the text or the notes database. It has
been seen in cases of malfunctioning hardware, such as unreliable memory. The
solution is to solve the hardware problem first, and restore the text or the
notes from a backup.</p>

<h4><a name="thelogsayscriticalunsupportedfileformat"></a>The log says:
CRITICAL**: unsupported file format</h4>

<p>This is caused by downgrading from a newer version of sqlite3 to an older
version. This may occur when the data is moved from a newer version of Linux
to an older version. A possible solution is to install the newest version of
sqlite3 in your current system. It will then be able to read your data
again.</p>

<h4><a name="bibleditwontstartanymore"></a>Bibledit won't start anymore</h4>

<p>Try starting it from a terminal, and see what happens. In the terminal
type:</p>
<pre>bibledit</pre>

<p>If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in your
configuration. A simple way to get Bibledit running again is to delete the
file ./bibledit/settings and ./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml. You
will loose all your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit should start
again after that.</p>

<p>If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your
configuration files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a gzipped
tarball, and attach this file to the <a href="development.html">bug
report</a>.</p>

<p>To go to the home directory, type</p>
<pre>cd</pre>

<p>To pack everything in a tarball, type</p>
<pre>tar -cvf bibledit.tar .bibledit</pre>

<p>Then compress the tarball:</p>
<pre>gzip bibledit.tar</pre>

<p>The resulting file is named bibledit.tar.gz and can be attached to the bug
report.</p>

<p>If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows nothing at all,
then the bibledit.log file might give a clue. It is in the <a
href="internals.html#temporaldirectory">temporary directory</a>. View the
logfile to see what went wrong.</p>

<h4><a name="bibleditisfrozenhowtosolvethat"></a>Bibledit is frozen. How to
solve that?</h4>

<p>Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a project, but the
book of Philemon freezes Bibledit completely. When restarting it, the screen
comes up, but none of the menus or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only
button that works is the one to exit the program (which brings up a box
giving me the option to force-quit).</p>

<p>Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a terminal,
type this:</p>
<pre>bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject</pre>

<p>Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project "testproject" - any
name will do here.</p>

<p>To change the whole configuration to default values type:</p>
<pre>bibledit --general-configuration --reset</pre>

<h4><a name="theonlinehelpdoesnotdisplay"></a>The online help does not
display</h4>

<p>Bibledit's online help depends on Bibledit's internal webserver. The
helpfiles only work while Bibledit is running. If you quit Bibledit, online
help is not available.</p>

<h4><a name="fieldworkslanguageexplorerinterfereswithcygwinx"></a>FieldWorks
Language Explorer interferes with Cygwin/X</h4>

<p>When Bibledit is running on Windows, FLEx won't start. While FLEx runs,
Bibledit will only start after a long delay due to a timeout. It won't have
clipboard functionality. The problem is being looked into. The current
workaround is to start FLEx first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you
can start Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit menu, and
in that terminal type "startx", and then "bibledit".</p>

<h3><a name="project"></a>Project</h3>

<h4><a
name="whenimportingdatainlegacyencodingcanbibledituseateckitmap"></a>When
importing data in legacy encoding, can Bibledit use a TECkit map?</h4>

<p>Bibledit uses iconv, the standard utility on Linux to convert between
various encodings.</p>

<p>Iconv supports a huge amount of standard encodings. Iconv does the same
functions as TECkit does.</p>

<p>Bibledit does not at present support a TECkit map, but that is going to
change in the future.</p>

<p>At conversion time the user sees how the text is going to look, and can
change encodings until the result looks right. If there are a couple of
characters not right, the search/replace functionality quickly fixes that.</p>

<h3><a name="printing"></a>Printing</h3>

<h4><a name="bibleditproducespdfoutputbuthowdoigethtmlfiles"></a>Bibledit
produces .pdf output, but how do I get .html files?</h4>

<p>There are a couple of converters on the market, that convert .pdf files to
.html. Use a search engine and look for "PDF to HTML", including the
quotation marks. This will give you a number of programs to try out.</p>

<h4><a name="wherearethefontsonmysystem"></a>Where are the fonts on my
system?</h4>

<p>Bibledit accesses the fonts on your system, and knows where they are. It
writes the fonts it uses to the file xep.xml in your XEP directory, where you
installed it. If you open that file in a <a href="texteditor.html">text
editor</a> you'll find your font locations.</p>

<h4><a name="bolddoesnotshowupinaprintout"></a>Bold does not show up in a
printout</h4>

<p>Question</p>

<p>Printing a Bibledit project to pdf format, using ArialUnicode and SIL
Doulos for it, I had the following problem:</p>

<p>* Feature Bold does not show up,</p>

<p>* Feature Italics shows up.</p>

<p>Trying the same with Open Office Writer and those two fonts, I found out,
that both do not show up neither in bold nor in italics.</p>

<p>Answer</p>

<p>SIL Doulos does not have bold.</p>

<p>Try Charis SIL, that does have bold, and works fine with me.</p>

<h4><a name="thefootnotecallerisdetachedfromtheworditbelongsto"></a>The
footnote caller is detached from the word it belongs to</h4>

<p>If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or crossreference
caller is always connected to the word it belongs to.</p>

<p>This is an example of proper code:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*</pre>

<p>The following two examples of code will cause the footnote caller to
detach from the word it belongs to:</p>

<p>Example one:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*</pre>

<p>Note the space between "man" and the "\f".</p>

<p>Example two:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man
\f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*</pre>

<p>In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space between
"man" and the "\f" here also.</p>

<p>Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also for the
footnotes. This needs correction in the current system. All note markers
(footnotes and cross-references) should not start on a new line, but follow
immediately the word it belongs to (without even a space).</p>

<p>Note that in newer versions of Bibledit the \f ... code for footnotes is
no longer visible - only the note itself is visible.</p>

<h4><a name="thefootnotecallertouchesthenextword"></a>The footnote caller
touches the next word</h4>

<p>If the caller at the bottom of the page touches the footnote text, then
you can increase the left margin of the footnote text. In the stylesheet
editor, edit the left margin of the Text, marker \ft, and if necessary also
for the Paragraph Mark, marker \fp.</p>

<p>Same applies to the Crossreferences. Make the setting under marker \xt.</p>

<h4><a name="adobereaderdoesnotloadaprinteddocument"></a>Adobe Reader does
not load a printed document</h4>

<p>This may occur in case Adobe Reader has a document loaded already. A
subsequent document, printed by Bibledit, may not load in the Reader. Newer
versions of the Reader do not have this problem.</p>

<h3><a name="navigation"></a>Navigation</h3>

<h4><a name="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit"></a>BART does not scroll with
Bibledit</h4>

<p>There can be various causes for this.</p>

<p>Cause 1. Has Bibledit Windows Outpost been installed?</p>

<p>Cause 2: Does it say "Windows Outpost: Connected" in the logfile?</p>

<p>Cause 3. When BART runs under Wine, did you install Bibledit Windows
Outpost in Wine too? Or when you installed BART in CrossOver Office, e.g.
bottle "win98", did you install the Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine
installation constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in
CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows machines. The system
BART uses for scrolling requires that it be accessed from the same Windows
machine. This means that if you installed BART in a certain bottle in
CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the
Outpost needs to be installed in that same bottle too.</p>

<p>Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references?</p>

<p>Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then you need to
start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver menu. It needs to be started
each time before you start Bibledit.</p>

<h4><a name="bibletimedoesnotscrollwithbibledit"></a>BibleTime does not
scroll with Bibledit</h4>

<p>Read some more info on <a href="bibletime.html">BibleTime</a>.</p>

<p>View the Logfile in the Help menu to ensure that there is a line that says
"BibleTime: Connected", and that there are no "BibleTime: " lines saying
anything wrong. If everything is right, then scrolling should occur.</p>

<p>Bibledit uses "dcop" to send scrolling commands to BibleTime. This can be
seen working by ticking menu Preferences / Debug. Then go to another verse,
view the logfile, and see a "BibleTime: dcop ..." command there. If this
command is there, then Bibledit's job has been done, and if there is still no
scrolling, the problem lies with either dcop or BibleTime. You can verify
this by executing the dcop command from a terminal and see whether BibleTime
scrolls, e.g. by typing</p>
<pre>dcop bibletime BibleTimeInterface syncAllVerseBasedModules 3John.1.8</pre>

<h4><a
name="scrollingdoesnotworkwhentheoutpostrunsonanotherhost"></a>Scrolling does
not work when the Outpost runs on another host</h4>

<p>Some points to check:</p>

<p>1. Ensure in the Windows Outpost preferences that Bibledit can contact the
other host.</p>

<p>2. Did you start the Outpost manually on the other host? Bibledit won't be
able to start it over the network, hence Outpost needs to be started
manually.</p>

<p>3. Bibledit uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure that this port
is opened in your firewall on Windows. If this port is closed, Bibledit can't
communicate with the Outpost.</p>

<h3><a name="exportimport"></a>Export / Import</h3>

<h4><a name="itsaysthattheswordcompilerwasnotfound"></a>It says that the
SWORD compiler was not found</h4>

<p>The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit uses this compiler
to export a project to SWORD format.</p>

<p>The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from source, but
from a binary package. Binary packages do not always install the compiler. If
you <a href="install_sword.html">install SWORD from source</a>, the compiler
will be installed too.</p>

<p>The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the compiler has been
installed, but Bibledit still cannot find it, the problem might be that the
compiler has not been installed in the program search path. Type</p>
<pre>echo $PATH</pre>

<p>in a terminal to see the program search path.</p>

<h4><a
name="whileexportingtoswordalltextwithinmyspeechmarkersdisappears"></a>While
exporting to SWORD, all text within my speech markers disappears</h4>

<p>All text between the speech markers disappears when exporting to SWORD.
E.g.</p>
<pre>And Jesus said: &lt;&lt;I am he&gt;&gt;.</pre>

<p>Everything between &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; disappears.</p>

<p>This is a bug in the current SWORD compiler. The bug has been reported.</p>

<p>A workaround is to use the Unicode speech markers, e.g.</p>
<pre>And Jesus said: Â«I am heÂ».</pre>

<h4><a name="segmentedverseslike1adonotshowinswordexport"></a>Segmented
verses like 1a do not show in SWORD export</h4>

<p>SWORD currently does not support segmented verses, like verse 1a. To
prevent problems Bibledit just takes any "a" or "b" out from the verse. SWORD
needs to be updated to support this.</p>

<h4><a name="markerltsomemarkergtdoesnotshowproperlyinbibletime"></a>Marker
&lt;some marker&gt; does not show properly in BibleTime</h4>

<p>Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names in Acts
13:1. The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs on separate lines, but
the font is changed from my default font for that language, and there is no
indenting. Under the form for editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place
to select the font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the
left seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can display? (That
might explain the lack of indenting, but it seems that the font should not
change.)</p>

<p>Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output Bibledit
generates for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <a
href="internals.html#temporaldirectory">temporary
directory</a>/sword_osis_input.txt. In this case, that of the \mi marker, it
can be seen that no indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any
font information.</p>

<p>This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime, and that the
indenting is not done because it does not get the information needed. If
somebody knows how to pass indenting information to BibleTime, pls. let the
programmer of Bibledit know and he can put that information in.</p>

<h3><a name="logfile"></a>Logfile</h3>

<h4><a name="pangowarning"></a>Pango-WARNING</h4>

<p>Question: When opening Bibledit and project NIV, the logfile says
"(bibledit:7567): Pango-WARNING **: Error loading GSUB table 4097". I'm not
sure what the warning means. The project goes ahead and opens.</p>

<p>Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango library
Bibledit is using. Most likely you are using a font that Pango has a problem
with. Problems with Pango can be reported at <a
href="http://www.pango.org">www.pango.org</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="webserveraddressalreadyinuse"></a>Webserver: Address already in
use</h4>

<p>Remark: On starting Bibledit sometimes the logfile says "Webserver:
Address already in use".</p>

<p>Reply: This happens after Bibledit crashed and is restarted after that.
The internal webserver cannot function properly because the previous one is
still running. To solve the problem, quit and start Bibledit once more.</p>
