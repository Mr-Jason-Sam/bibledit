<h4><a name="howtogethelpfromthebibleditcommunity"></a>How to get help from the Bibledit community?</h4>
<p>* Read the <a href="questions.html">questions and answers.</a></p>
<p>* Search the <a href="contacts.html">mailing list archives</a> to see if
your problem has been discussed before.</p>
<p>* Subscribe to the <a href="contacts.html">bibledit-general mailing
list</a>, and ask the question there.</p>
<h4><a name="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously"></a>How to run two versions of Bibledit simultanously?</h4>
<p>As there are some drastic changes between versions, it would be helpful to
have two different versions running of Bibledit.</p>
<p>This is possible, but not recommended for production work, as they will be
overwriting each other's configuration.</p>
<p>Do it this way.</p>
<p>Install the newer version according to the instructions.</p>
<p>When installing the older version, do this:</p>
<pre>./configure --prefix=/home/joe/older
make
sudo make install</pre>
<p>Then to run the older version, type this:</p>
<pre>/home/joe/older/bin/bibledit</pre>
<p>Joe stands for the user's name.</p>
<h4><a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks"></a>How to change the order of the books?</h4>
<p>You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the
books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the
order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.</p>
<h4><a name="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata"></a>How to modify the place where Bibledit stores its data?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Normally Bibledit stores its data in subdirectory ".bibledit" of the user's
home directory, e.g. in </p>
<pre>/home/joe/.bibledit</pre>
<p>If it is desirable to have Bibledit store its data elsewhere, the solution
is simple:</p>
<p>1. Move the current .bibledit directory to the new directory.</p>
<p>2. Create a symbolic link from .bibledit to that new directory.</p>
<p>There is a different way of pointing Bibledit to another data directory.</p>
<p>Changing is not done from within bibledit, but involves some manual work.
This is done for the protection of your valuable data. To change the data
directory to a new location, do the following:</p>
<p>Quit bibledit.</p>
<p>Open a terminal.</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<p>to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store the data on
/mnt/server/.bibledit</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>
<p>to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing data, this
step is not needed.)</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer</pre>
<p>to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to the new data
directory.</p>
<p>Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one line in it:</p>
<pre>/mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit to use the
standard datafolder again.</p>
<p>See also <a href="backup.html">backup</a>.</p>
<p>Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows partition. In
such cases problems have been observed when special characters are used in the
project name.</p>
<h4><a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks1"></a>How to change the order of the books?</h4>
<p>You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the
books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the
order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.</p>
<h4><a name="howtomoveaboutinbibleditusingthekeyboard"></a>How to move about in Bibledit using the keyboard?</h4>
<p>Bibledit has several <a href="areas.html">areas</a> to work in.</p>
<p>In Menu / GoTo there are hotkeys mentioned to move between areas.</p>
<p>On some distributions F5 (Text Area) and Shift+F5 (Tools Area) work fine,
but Ctrl+F5 (Project Notes Area) will not work. It leaves the cursor in the
area it is.</p>
<p>What works fine, is the</p>
<p>* Tab key: moves between all areas counter-clockwise,</p>
<p>* Shift+Tab: moves cursor between areas clockwise,</p>
<p>with the exception text area to references area. In this case Shift+Tab has
to used twice, as using it once goes to the verse box of the toolbar.</p>
<h4><a name="howtoprintatableofcontents"></a>How to print a table of contents?</h4>
<p>In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table of contents
for a project consisting of several books.</p>
<p>The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter. Therefore, add
this book to the project.</p>
<p>Each book that should go into the table of contents should have a USFM
indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each book and add the \toc2
marker to it. For example, in the book of Genesis, chapter 0 might look like</p>
<pre>\id GEN
\h Genesis
\toc2 Genesis</pre>
<p>Do this for all the books.</p>
<p>Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books, including
Front Matter. The table of contents will be there.</p>
<h4><a name="howtocreateacustomversificationsystemorlanguage"></a>How to create a custom versification system or language?</h4>
<p>If the versification system or language you need does not come with
Bibledit, then you can create your own language or versification system and add
it to Bibledit yourself. To do that, take an existing versification textfile or
language textfile from /usr/share/bibledit, edit it, and save it in the <a
href="data_directory.html">data directory</a>, subdirectory templates.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>The versification files start with versification_, the mapping files with
mapping_, and the language files with language_. It is important to keep that
first bit, else Bibledit won't recognize the files.</p>
<p>If the name of a template you added is the same as the name one of the
templates that come with Bibledit, your template will be taken.</p>
<p>It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share the files you
have created with others. In that way others will benefit from the work that
you have already done. A good way of sharing it with the community is to submit
it for inclusion into Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the
next release.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanicountthenumberofcrossreferencesintheproject"></a>How can I count the number of crossreferences in the project?</h4>
<p>This can be done through menu Tools, then Bible notes mass update. Tick
"Crossreferences", and leave the action to take as "Make no changes but give
statistics only". After clicking OK it will give the number of crossreferences
in the project.</p>
