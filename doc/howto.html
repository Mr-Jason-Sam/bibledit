<h4><a name="howtogethelpfromthebibleditcommunity"></a>How to get help from
the Bibledit community?</h4>

<p>* Read the <a href="questions.html">questions and answers.</a></p>

<p>* Search the <a href="contacts.html">mailing list archives</a> to see if
your problem has been discussed before.</p>

<p>* Subscribe to the <a href="contacts.html">bibledit-general mailing
list</a>, and ask the question there.</p>

<h4><a name="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously"></a>How to run two
versions of Bibledit simultanously?</h4>

<p>As there are some drastic changes between versions, it would be helpful to
have two different versions running of Bibledit.</p>

<p>This is possible, but not recommended for production work, as they will be
overwriting each other's configuration.</p>

<p>Do it this way.</p>

<p>Install the newer version according to the instructions.</p>

<p>When installing the older version, do this:</p>
<pre>./configure --prefix=/home/joe/older
make
sudo make install</pre>

<p>Then to run the older version, type this:</p>
<pre>/home/joe/older/bin/bibledit</pre>

<p>Joe stands for the user's name.</p>

<h4><a name="howtochangethelocationwherebibleditstoresitsdata"></a>How to
change the location where Bibledit stores its data?</h4>

<p>Normally bibledit stores its data in subdirectory .bibledit of the user's
home directory.</p>

<p>Changing that is not done from within bibledit, but involves some manual
work. This is done for the protection of your valuable data. To change the
data directory to a new location, do the following:</p>

<p>Quit bibledit.</p>

<p>Open a terminal.</p>

<p>Type command</p>
<pre>cd</pre>

<p>to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store the data on
/mnt/server/.bibledit</p>

<p>Type command</p>
<pre>mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>

<p>to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing data, this
step is not needed.)</p>

<p>Type command</p>
<pre>touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer</pre>

<p>to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to the new data
directory.</p>

<p>Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one line in
it:</p>
<pre>/mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit to use the
standard datafolder again.</p>

<p>See also <a href="backup.html">backup</a>.</p>

<p>Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows partition. In
such cases problems have been observed when special characters are used in
the project name.</p>

<h4><a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks"></a>How to change the order of
the books?</h4>

<p>You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the
books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the
order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.</p>

<h4><a name="howtoletbibleditandparatextworktogetherononeproject"></a>How to
let Bibledit and Paratext work together on one project?</h4>

<p>Paratext remains as it is, and Bibledit accesses Paratext's data files.</p>

<p>Below is an example that shows how to get this working. More information
is in the topic about <a href="collaboration.html">collaboration</a>.</p>

<p>- We have a Paratext project in our Windows partition. It is at
/home/joe/windows/My Paratext Projects/NDB. When Windows runs, we can work on
those files using Paratext. But we wish to work on the same files using
Bibledit too, from Linux.</p>

<p>- We start Bibledit and create a new project called Ndebele.</p>

<p>- We import all the files at /home/joe/windows/My Paratext Projects/NDB
into our project, and choose "Link to them" in the import dialog.</p>

<p>You can now edit some text, exit Bibledit, go to Windows, and to Paratext,
and see that the changes made in Bibledit are also visible in Paratext. You
can make some changes in Paratext, save them, exit Paratext and Windows and
go to Bibledit, and see that the changes appear here too.</p>

<h4><a name="howtomoveaboutinbibleditusingthekeyboard"></a>How to move about
in Bibledit using the keyboard?</h4>

<p>Bibledit has several <a href="areas.html">areas</a> to work in.</p>

<p>In Menu / GoTo there are hotkeys mentioned to move between areas.</p>

<p>On some distributions F5 (Text Area) and Shift+F5 (Tools Area) work fine,
but Ctrl+F5 (Project Notes Area) will not work. It leaves the cursor in the
area it is.</p>

<p>What works fine, is the</p>

<p>* Tab key: moves between all areas counter-clockwise,</p>

<p>* Shift+Tab: moves cursor between areas clockwise,</p>

<p>with the exception text area to references area. In this case Shift+Tab
has to used twice, as using it once goes to the verse box of the toolbar.</p>

<h4><a name="howtoprintatableofcontents"></a>How to print a table of
contents?</h4>

<p>In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table of contents
for a project consisting of several books.</p>

<p>The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter. Therefore,
add this book to the project.</p>

<p>Each book that should go into the table of contents should have a USFM
indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each book and add the \toc2
marker to it. For example, in the book of Genesis, chapter 0 might look
like</p>
<pre>\id GEN
\h Genesis
\toc2 Genesis</pre>

<p>Do this for all the books.</p>

<p>Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books, including
Front Matter. The table of contents will be there.</p>

<h4><a name="howtocreateacustomversificationsystemorlanguage"></a>How to
create a custom versification system or language?</h4>

<p>If the versification system or language you need does not come with
Bibledit, then you can create a new versfication system on the wiki of <a
href="http://scripturechecks.sourceforge.net">Scripture Checks</a>. Once it
is on that wiki, it usually makes it into Bibledit after about a week. This
is the simplest way for you.</p>

<p>You can also create your own language or versification system and add it
to Bibledit yourself. To do that, take an existing versification system
textfile or language textfile from /usr/share/bibledit, edit it, and save it
in the <a href="data_directory.html">data directory</a>, subdirectory
templates.</p>

<p>Restart Bibledit, and you'll notice it creating new templates.</p>

<p>Notes.</p>

<p>The versification files start with vrs_, the mapping files with map_, and
the language files with language_. It is important to keep that first bit,
else Bibledit won't recognize the files.</p>

<p>If the name of a template you added is the same as the name one of the
templates that come with Bibledit, your template will be taken.</p>

<p>As Bibledit evolves your versification system or language may not be
compatible with a newer version of Bibledit. To keep it compatible, it is
recommended you create your data on the wiki of <a
href="http://scripturechecks.sourceforge.net">Scripture Checks</a>. A more
important reason for sharing your data on the wiki would be that by doing so
you would help others too in that they benefit from the work you've already
done.</p>

<h4>How can I count the number of crossreferences in the project?</h4>

<p>This can be done through menu Tools, then Bible notes mass update. Tick
"Crossreferences", and leave the action to take as "Make no changes but give
statistics only". After clicking OK it will give the number of
crossreferences in the project.</p>
