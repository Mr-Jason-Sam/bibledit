<h2><a name="importingkeyterms"></a>Importing keyterms</h2>

<p>Extra keyterms can be imported. This is done through menu File / Keyterms /
Import.</p>

<p>The file that will be imported has to adhere to certain standards. The
various files with keyterms that come with Bibledit show what the format of the
textfiles should be.</p>

<p>There are several different types of textfiles than can be imported.</p>

<p>1. There is the Standard textfile. Samples of this type of file are in the
bibledit distribution or are installed in, normally, /usr/share/bibledit. These
files start with "keyterms" and have the "txt" extension. So looking for files
like "keyterms*txt" will give them.</p>

<p>2. There is the OTKEY.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit
distribution.</p>

<p>3. There is the KTREF.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit
distribution.</p>

<p>4. There is the data produced by the <a
href="http://www.ktbh-team.org/">"Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew" project</a>.
This is supported too. It is included with bibledit as KTBH.pbu. If an update
is available, you can import it through the Import function.</p>

<p>The keyterms will be imported into a collection. This should be a new
collection, one that does not yet exist.</p>

<p>If you have messed up the keyterms by importing garbage, the collection that
was imported can be <a href="olh_deletekeyterms.html">deleted</a> again.</p>

<p>Any keyterms that have been added become available after Bibledit has been
restarted.</p>
