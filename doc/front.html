<p>There are many people that need a good translation of the Bible in their
language. Working toward having one is like the sunrise in the darkness.</p>
<p><img alt="bibledit" src="biblesociety.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Bible translators need a text editor that can input Bible text.</p>
<p>Many Bible translators use the USFM data format for their Bible
translations, but the most widespread USFM text editors require Windows.
Bibledit is a multi-platform USFM Bible editor or Scripture processor.</p>
<p>It has been designed for the glory of God and the salvation of the
people.</p>
<p>Bibledit does not use a lot of memory, yet it provides a good number of
useful functions.</p>
<p>It can be installed on a memory stick too, and the translator can work on
any computer using that stick and a live CD.</p>
<p>On older computers, Bibledit runs well on a light version of Linux, for
example Xubuntu.</p>
