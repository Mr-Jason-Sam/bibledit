<h2><a name="installjava"></a>Install Java</h2>

<p>Download a Sun Java virtual machine from <a
href="http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp.</a></p>

<p>Choose the "Linux (self extracting file)", which gives a file called
jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin in the home directory, or a higher version.</p>

<p>Open a terminal.</p>

<p>In the terminal, to verify the package is there, type</p>
<pre>ls</pre>

<p>To install the package, type</p>
<pre>sh jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</pre>

<p>Agree to the license and complete installing Java.</p>

<p>Make a note of the directory where Java got installed. In this case this is
~/jre1.5.0_06</p>

<p>Note. If you install it in the directory given above, then Bibledit will
find Java automatically. If you install it elsewhere, you need to enter the
path to Java by hand.</p>

<p>Note. Some Linux distributions come with their own version of Java
installed. It may be quite a hassle to find out where this version of Java has
been installed, and so it may be difficult to fill in the directory in
Bibledit. In case you encounter trouble to find that directory, it will be
easier to just download the Java version as described above, and install it
following the instructions.</p>
