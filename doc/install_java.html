<h2><a name="installjava"></a>Install Java</h2>
<p>Download a Sun Java virtual machine from <a href=
"http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp.</a></p>
<p>Choose the "Linux (self extracting file)", which gives a file
called jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin in the home directory, or a
higher version.</p>
<p>Open a terminal.</p>
<p>In the terminal, to verify the package is there, type</p>
<pre>
ls
</pre>
<p>To install the package, type</p>
<pre>
sh jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin
</pre>
<p>Agree to the license and complete installing Java.</p>
<p>Make a note of the directory where Java got installed. In this
case this is ~/jre1.5.0_06</p>
<p>Note. If you install it in the directory given above, then
Bibledit will find Java automatically. If you install it elsewhere,
you need to enter the path to Java by hand.</p>
<p>Note. Some Linux distributions come with their own version of
Java installed. It may be quite a hassle to find out where this
version of Java has been installed, and so it may be difficult to
fill in the directory in Bibledit. In case you encounter trouble to
find that directory, it will be easier to just download the Java
version as described above, and install it following the
instructions. And moreover, the GNU version of Java, gij, is not
enough for XEP. Hence, if this version comes with your Linux
distribution, you still need to install the one from Sun.</p>
