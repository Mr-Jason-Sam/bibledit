<h2><a name="planning"></a>Planning</h2>
<p>Bibledit can produce a planning. This shows the various tasks that have
been planned for the project, when they start and finish, and how far they
have progressed.</p>
<p>There are four places in the Bibledit menu that are relevant to
planning.</p>
<p>1. <a href="olh_preferences_reporting.html">Preferences / Reporting</a>.
Here is where the various tasks are set and the times they take to complete
one chapter.</p>
<p>2. Preferences / Planning. Here is where to enter when the project
started.</p>
<p>3. Edit / Planning. This dialog shows a list of tasks that have been
planned for the project. The user can add and delete tasks, or reorder
them.</p>
<p>4. View / Planning. This produces the report. It contains an estimated
date of completion, and a list of planned tasks with their duration, when
they start and finish. The duration of a task is calculated based on the
number of days per chapter this task takes, multiplied by the number of
chapters in the book this task is about.</p>
