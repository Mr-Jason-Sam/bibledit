<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bibledit can assist you in planning the work.</p>
<p>There are three places in the Bibledit menu that are relevant to
planning.</p>
<p>1. Preferences / Planning. This is for setting it up.</p>
<p>2. Edit / Planning. This is for editing the planning and status.</p>
<p>3. View / Planning. This shows the planning and reports on progress made.</p>
<p>How it works is going to be explained below by an example.</p>
<h3><a name="settingup"></a>Setting up</h3>
<p>Go to menu Preferences / Planning. The Planning Setup dialog shows.</p>
<p>The first thing to do in that dialog is to indicate when the project was
started.</p>
<p>After that you can enter the tasks that the project consists of. Let's add
two tasks, "First draft", and "Final draft".</p>
<p>The last thing to do is to indicate how much time each task takes to
complete one chapter. Let's enter three days per chapter for the first draft,
and two days per chapter for the final draft.</p>
<p>This sets you up for making a planning and for reporting the progress.</p>
<h3><a name="updatingprogress"></a>Updating progress</h3>
<p>Once you have set up everything, the next thing to do is to update the
progress of the work. This can be done through menu Edit / Planning. If this is
chosen, a dialog, called "Planning Edit" shows.</p>
<p>You can <a href="olh_edit_status.html">edit the project's status</a>. This
means that you can tick off which bits of work have been completed.</p>
<p>For making a planning for the shorter term, you can enter which task are
supposed to be done.</p>
<h3><a name="statusreport"></a>Status report</h3>
<p>In order to view the status report, choose View / Planning. This should give
a report of the progress you make, and the planning.</p>
