<p>This dialog is accessed through menu File / Project / Properties, then
button Dictionaries.</p>
<p>The dialog lists the dictionaries that are used for checking the spelling of
the text of the project.</p>
<h3><a name="connecting"></a>Connecting</h3>
<p>Press button "Connect" to connect to a dictionary and add it to the list.</p>
<p>There are various types of dictionaries that can be added.</p>
<p>- "Project &lt;project name&gt; Shared Dictionary. This dictionary belongs
to a project. It is called "shared", because if <a
href="collaboration.html">collaboration</a> is used, the dictionary is shared
with other workstations.</p>
<p>- Dictionaries that have two-letter names, such as "en", "he", "en_ZW", and
so forth. These are dictionaries that are installed on your system. Bibledit
does not know what these abbreviations mean. Some of them can be guessed. It
depends entirely on which dictionaries you have installed on your system.</p>
<p>- "Global Dictionary". This is one global dictionary provided by
Bibledit.</p>
<h3><a name="disconnecting"></a>Disconnecting</h3>
<p>To disconnect a dictionary, select it, and press the Disconnect button.</p>
<p>If a dictionary is "disconnected", it remains on disk. This dictionary is no
longer used to check the text of the project.</p>
<h3><a name="editing"></a>Editing</h3>
<p>Some <a href="olh_editdictionary.html">dictionaries can be edited</a>, and
others cannot. If a dictionary can be edited, then the "Edit" button is
sensitive. If this button is clicked, all the words in the dictionary become
visible. These can be edited, and if Ok is pressed, these are saved to disk.</p>
<h3><a name="order"></a>Order</h3>
<p>If spelling of text is to be checked, Bibledit consults all the dictionaries
that are in the list. It starts from the top one, and works to the bottom, in
order to find the word. If you wish to use another order, you can drag a
dictionary to another position.</p>
<h3><a name="systemdictionaries"></a>System dictionaries</h3>
<p>Bibledit accesses the dictionaries through Enchant. Enchant supports a
variety of spelling check programs. It supports Aspell, Hspell, Ispell,
MySpell, and so forth. Any dictionaries installed on your system for these
spelling checkers will become available to Bibledit through Enchant. For
example, if Dutch spelling checking is desired using Aspell, then a package
like with a name like "aspell-nl" should be installed. Once done, this language
is available.</p>
