<h2><a name="introductiontocollaboration"></a>Introduction to collaboration</h2>

<p>With Bibledit several users can work on one Bible at the same time.</p>

<p>The users collaborate through the network or a USB drive.</p>

<p>Once everything has been set up, it all goes automatic. The user does not
notice the mechanics of the collaboration, it all happens under the hood.</p>

<p>There is a variety of methods for collaboration. The user who will set it
all up needs to have sufficient knowledge of information technology.</p>

<p>Bibledit stores all data locally. When collaboration is enabled, it also
connects to a central repository. Through that repository the data gets shared
between the users.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content
manager. The user does not notice that Git is used. He does not operate it.
Bibledit does it all for him. The only thing that the user notices is that the
changes introduced by the other users appear on his screen too.</p>

<p>There is a variety of repositories that can be used. Each of them has it own
use, advantages and disadvantages. First of all there is the repository that
resides on a file system. A <span style="font-weight:bold;">USB flash
drive</span> can be used in this case. This flash drive can be physically moved
from one user to the other, and so on, updating each user, and getting updated
by each user. Secondly there is the repository that resides on the network. For
internal networks a simple <span style="font-weight:bold;">open network
repository</span> can be used. Whosoever knows where the repository resides can
write to it. For public networks such as the internet a <span
style="font-weight:bold;">secure network repository</span> would be
recommended. This type of repository is locked down. Only those who have the
keys to such a repository can write to it.</p>
