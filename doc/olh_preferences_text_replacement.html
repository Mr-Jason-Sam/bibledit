<h2><a name="textreplacement"></a>Text replacement</h2>
<p>The dialog for automatic text replacement is accessible through menu
Preferences / Text replacement.</p>
<p>Bibledit can replace certain text with other text for printing and export.
For example, whenever the text &lt;&lt; occurs, it can be replaced with an
opening quotation mark. And &gt;&gt; can be replaced with a closing quotation
mark.</p>
<p>These texts, and their replacements, can be set through the dialog.</p>
<p>First thing to do is to enable this feature in the dialog.</p>
<p>Next thing is to enter all texts and their replacements. To set a text,
click once on the text where it says "Set new text (or replacement) here",
then click once again, type the new text, and press Enter.</p>
<p>To remove a text and its replacement, just erase it.</p>
<p>Press Ok to save the values.</p>
<p>Note. When exporting to USFM, no replacement is done.</p>
