<h2><a name="installwine"></a>Install Wine</h2>
<p>Installing Wine is outside the scope of the Bibledit helpfiles. See Wine's
site at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">http://www.winehq.org</a>.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to install winetools also, see the same site.</p>
<p>A certain version of winetools will only work properly with a certain
version of wine.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, it was found that winetools version
winetools-0.9-3 works well with wine version wine-0.9.2, but not well with
later versions of wine.</p>
<p>To start winetools, in the terminal type</p>
<pre>winetools</pre>
<p>Click OK a few times.</p>
<p>In the WineTools window, select "Base setup" and click OK.</p>
<p>In the Base Setup window, create a fake Windows drive and follow all
instructions on the screen. When through, notice the place where the fake
windows drive was created, in ~/.wine</p>
<p>A fake Windows drive is different from any existing real Windows partition
you might have, and the Wine fake Windows drive will not affect it.</p>
<p>Connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Install TrueType font Arial.</p>
<p>Install DCOM98.</p>
<p>Install Microsoft Foundation Classes 4.x.</p>
<p>Install Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1.</p>
<p>Click Main Menu to go back in the WineTools window. From there choose
Install Windows system software and click OK.</p>
<p>From the System Software window, install Windows Installer.</p>
<p>Install MDAC 2.8 and Jet 4.0 SP8.</p>
<p>Install MSXML 4.0 Service Pack 2.</p>
<p>Install Windows Script 5.6.</p>
<p>Install Common Controls 5.0.</p>
<p>Click Main Menu to close the window.</p>
<p>In the WineTools window, click and install Microsoft TrueType core fonts.
Install all of them.</p>
<p>Close WineTools.</p>
<p>Note. With winetools you can uninstall software, kill any wine processes
that hang, reboot Windows, and so on.</p>
