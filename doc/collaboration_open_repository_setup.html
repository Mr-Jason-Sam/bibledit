<h2><a name="opennetworkrepositorysetup"></a>Open network repository setup</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to set up an open repository on the
network.</p>

<p>To create the repository on we need a server. Any of your Linux computers
that is attached to your network will do. In this tutorial we assume that the
computer is accessible from the network through IP address 192.168.0.1. The
user of this computer will be Jim.</p>

<p>To create the repository, login as user jim. Then open a terminal. The
repository is going to be in Jim's home directory. In the terminal type the
following:</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<pre>mkdir -p git/repository</pre>
<pre>cd git/repository</pre>
<pre>git --bare init --shared</pre>

<p>The repository is now there, but it is not yet accessible from the
network.</p>

<p>To make the repository available to the network, type</p>
<pre>git daemon --export-all --base-path=/home/jim/git --detach --enable=receive-pack</pre>

<p>Each time that the server boots, it is necessary to execute the above
command again. It would be easier to put the command in the boot script. Then
it will automatically be started after boot.</p>

<p>To test access to the new repository from another computer on the network,
type</p>
<pre>git ls-remote git://192.168.0.1/repository</pre>

<p>If everthing is fine, no errors will occur.</p>

<p>The repository that was created in this tutorial has the following URL:</p>
<pre>git://192.168.0.1/repository</pre>

<p>The users that are going to use this repository need this URL.</p>
