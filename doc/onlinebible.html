<h2><a name="onlinebible"></a>Online Bible</h2>

<p>At the time of writing this, September 2009, older versions of the Online
Bible do not run properly on Wine. As from version 3.95, released on 24
September 2009, it runs well on Wine and has implemented reference sharing with
Bibledit.</p>

<p>A bit of help follows below. It may help you getting the Online Bible
running on Linux and getting reference sharing to work.</p>

<p>Install the Online Bible on Linux through wine:</p>
<pre>wine install_advance.exe</pre>

<p>After installing it, run it as follows:</p>
<pre>wine "c:\Program Files\Bible\olb.exe"</pre>

<p>Start Bibledit, go to menu Preferences / Reference exchange, and tick the
option to send references to the Online Bible.</p>

<p>In Bibledit, menu Preferences / Windows Outpost, enable the Outpost, and
when locating Wine, use plain Wine.</p>

<p>That's all what's to it.</p>

<p>When if you change a reference, you will notice that the Online Bible
starts, and that its desktop is empty. In the Online Bible, Open a Bible or
press F6 to open a desktop, move Bibledit to another verse, and notice that the
Online Bible scrolls along with Bibledit.</p>
