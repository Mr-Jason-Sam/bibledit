<p>To install Bibledit, you'll need the DVD version of Knoppix, but to run it
the CD version is sufficient.</p>

<p>To install Bibledit, you need to create a persistent disk image, which can
be saved on a thumbdrive. You can then take the Knoppix CD with you, and the
thumbdrive, and run Bibledit on any computer.</p>

<p>To make a persistent disk image, boot the DVD, insert the thumbdrive, and in
Knoppix click the second button at the bottom from the left, and choose
Configure, then "Create a persistent KNOPPIX disk image". Follow the
instructions on the screen to make that image. An image of 100 Mbyte is large
enough.</p>

<p>Next, open a terminal, by clicking the sixth button at the bottom, from the
left.</p>

<p><a href="run.html">Run Bibledit</a>.</p>

<p>Note.</p>

<p>After Bibledit has been installed, or editing has been done on it, be sure
to shut the system down properly. This is because it needs to synchronize the
thumb drive.</p>

<p>Next time, insert the thumb drive, boot from the CD (or the DVD), and when
asked about the thumb drive leave the options as they are and choose ok, and
you're ready to run Bibledit.</p>
