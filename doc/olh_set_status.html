<h2><a name="setstatus"></a>Set Status</h2>
<p>This dialog is accessible from menu Edit / Status, then clicking any of
the buttons there.</p>
<p>It shows all the tasks that a project consists of.</p>
<p>Put a tick before any of these to indicate that this task has been
done.</p>
<p>If there is no tick, then this status has yet to be done.</p>
<p>At times there is another symbol that indicates that the task has not been
consistently completed. Such a state occurs when for example the status of a
chapter is displayed, and not all the verses of that chapter have a
particular task completed. Some have, and others don't.</p>
