<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bibledit allows several users to work on one Bible at the same time.</p>
<p>Collaboration can happen through the network, or a USB stick.</p>
<p>Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content
manager. The user does not notice that Git is used, neither does he operate it.
Bibledit does it all for him. The person that sets up the collaboration,
though, will have to use a few Git commands once. Once everything is set up, it
all goes automatic.</p>
<p>Bibledit stores all data locally, but when collaboration is enabled, it
connects to a central repository. The repository will be on the network, or on
the USB stick. The data is shared through that repository.</p>
<h3><a name="localrepository"></a>Local repository</h3>
<p>Whether collaboration is done through the network or the USB stick, in both
cases the local repository needs to be created. If you'd like to create the
local repository, you can follow these steps.</p>
<p>- Start Bibledit and leave it running till you have set everything up.</p>
<p>- Consider the project that you'd like to collaborate on. In this example we
take a project Ndebele.</p>
<p>- Open a terminal, and change to the data directory of the Ndebele
project:</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<pre>cd .bibledit/projects/Ndebele/data</pre>
<p>- Initialize the local repository:</p>
<pre>git init</pre>
<p>It will respond saying that a Git repository was initialized.</p>
<p>- Add all the files to the repository:</p>
<pre>git add *</pre>
<p>- Commit the data into the repository:</p>
<pre>git commit -a -m init</pre>
<p>This should finish the job. Just to check whether all went well, you can
issue the status command:</p>
<pre>git status</pre>
<p>If it says that it is on branch master, and that there is nothing to commit,
that means that all is well.</p>
<h3><a name="network"></a>Network</h3>
<p>If several users work together on one project using the network, then if
somebody makes a change in the text of the Bible, within a short time that
change will be propagated to the other users. They will see that change on
their screens too.</p>
<p>First of all somebody knowledgeable with computers and networks needs to <a
href="collaborate_network.html">set up the collaboration</a>. </p>
<p>After that it will go all smoothly.</p>
<h3><a name="usbstick"></a>USB stick</h3>
<p>If several users work together on one project using a USB stick, then the
changes need to be physically carried from one user's computer to the one of
the other user. If a stick is inserted into a computer, and everything has been
set up properly, then the data is moved to and from the USB stick
automatically. Normally one user will work on the data for a while, then insert
the USB stick and have the stick be updated automatically. Then the stick will
be carried to the other user. He will insert the stick too, and then his data
will be updated using the data on the stick, and he will also on his turn
update the data on the stick. So the stick can then be moved to the first user,
and so on. By keeping on moving the stick between the computers, all data will
be updated, and all changes will get propagated to all users. All the users
will see the changes on their screens.</p>
<p>To start off with this, somebody knowledgeable with computers needs to <a
href="collaborate_usb_stick.html">set up the collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>After that all will goo smoothly.</p>
<h3><a name="collaborating"></a>Collaborating</h3>
<p>Now we come to the purpose of everything, which is working together on one
project.</p>
<p>This collaboration is very simple: Just work on your data as you did
before.</p>
<p>Bibledit cares for everything, and everything will be updated and shared
automatically.</p>
<p>On rare occasions you might notice that the chapter you are working on
changes. This happens if somebody else works on the same chapter as you, and
made some changes in it.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<p>For worldwide collaboration, a server can be set up on the internet, and
used by all parties. Instead of entering git://192.168.0.6/repository or
git://localhost/repository as the repository, for example, it will be something
like git://repo.mydomain.org/repository.</p>
<p>The collaboration system can conveniently be used for automatic backup. The
system that uses the USB stick for collaboration works well for that. The USB
stick can be carried around.</p>
<p>Collaboration of two projects on the same computer is possible if those
projects have the same ancestor, that is, one is created by importing all the
Biblebooks exported of the other one. This can be helpful for demo purposes and
to test and learn to use this tool if only one computer is available.</p>
<p>Sending and receiving the data of your Bible will happen automatically at
intervals. Bibledit will receive any changes from the repository, and then send
its own changes to that repository. To manually send and receive your Bible,
use menu File / Send / receive.</p>
