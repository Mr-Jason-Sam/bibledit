<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>When speaking about references, we refer to the list of <a
href="glossary.html#reference">references</a> available in the <a
href="areas.html">References Area.</a></p>
<h3><a name="howtoloadreferences"></a>How to load references?</h3>
<p>References are loaded in the References Area.</p>
<p>References can be loaded as a result of:</p>
<p>* A <a href="searching.html">search</a> operation.</p>
<p>* Opening a list of references, through menu File - References - Open.</p>
<p>* Checking.</p>
<p>* Getting them from a projectnote.</p>
<p>When a list of references is opened, up to three words can be chosen to be
highlighted in the Text Area, when a reference is activated in the References
Area.</p>
<h3><a name="howtogotoareference"></a>How to go to a reference?</h3>
<p>The references list is used to quickly navigate to the verse referred to.
Just double-click on the reference and Bibledit presents that verse in the
Text Area.</p>
<p>Within the references area a keyboard navigation aid is active. To locate
example, Matthew, go through the following steps</p>
<p>* Click in the references area to select it.</p>
<p>* Type the key sequence mat</p>
<p>Bibledit moves to the first reference for the book of Matthew.</p>
<p>Other navigation aids:</p>
<p>* Next Reference (F6): Actives the first reference, or if one is active
already (except the last one), the next one.</p>
<p>* Previous Reference (Shift+F6) Actives the first reference, or if one is
active already (except the first one), the previous one.</p>
<p>* When the Reference Area is active (the cursor is visible in it) the
cursor can be moved up/down by the Up/Down arrow keys, which selects the
previous/next reference in the list at the same time. In order to activate
the selected reference in the list, Enter is used.</p>
<h3><a name="howtosavereferences"></a>How to save references?</h3>
<p>A list of references can be saved through the menu, File - References -
Save as. This will give a list, saved to disk, with all the references that
are presently in the References Area, one reference per line.</p>
<h3><a name="howtohidereferences"></a>How to hide references?</h3>
<p>Any references that are at present in the References Area can be hidden
for the future. Right-click on that reference, and choose Hide from now on.
It won't come back in the future.</p>
<p>The list of references that has been hidden can be seen and edited via
menu Preferences - Ignored references.</p>
<h3><a name="howtoprintreferences"></a>How to print references?</h3>
<p>To print references, including the text they refer to, type Ctrl+P or
choose menu File - References - Print.</p>
<h3><a name="howtogobacktoanoriginalreference"></a>How to go back to an original reference?</h3>
<p>When working in a text and going to another reference, it is important to
have a way to find back to the original reference.</p>
<p>The Menu / Goto / Previous Reference in History, or the keys Previous/Next
in the toolbar (green arrows to the left/right) can be used to go to the the
original reference in the Text Area. This is the text before any reference of
the Reference Area was activated.</p>
<h3><a name="howtoquicklyseethetextofareference"></a>How to quickly see the text of a reference?</h3>
<p>To see the text of a reference, click on it once, and the verse will be
displayed in the Quick Reference Area.</p>
