<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>When speaking about references, we refer to the list of <a
href="glossary.html#reference">references</a> available in the <a
href="areas.html">References Area.</a></p>
<h3><a name="howtoloadreferences"></a>How to load references?</h3>
<p>References are loaded in the References Area.</p>
<p>References can be loaded as a result of:</p>
<p>* A <a href="searching.html">search</a> operation.</p>
<p>* Opening a list of references, through menu View / References, then click
[actions] and then "Import a list of references".</p>
<p>* Checking.</p>
<p>* Getting them from a projectnote.</p>
<p>When a list of references is opened, up to three words can be chosen to be
highlighted in the Text Area, when a reference is activated in the References
Area.</p>
<h3><a name="howtogotoareference"></a>How to go to a reference?</h3>
<p>The references list is used to quickly navigate to the verse referred to.
Just click on the reference and Bibledit presents that verse in the Text
Area.</p>
<p>Navigation aids:</p>
<p>* Next Reference (F6): Actives the first reference, or if one is active
already (except the last one), the next one.</p>
<p>* Previous Reference (Shift+F6) Actives the first reference, or if one is
active already (except the first one), the previous one.</p>
<h3><a name="howtosavereferences"></a>How to save references?</h3>
<p>A list of references can be saved through menu, File / Export. See <a
href="olh_export.html">information about exporting data</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="howtohidereferences"></a>How to hide references?</h3>
<p>Any references that are at present in the References Area can be hidden for
the future. Click [actions], then "Hide ... from now on". It won't come back in
the future.</p>
<p>The list of references that has been hidden can be seen and edited via
[actions], then "Manage the hidden references".</p>
<h3><a name="howtoprintreferences"></a>How to print references?</h3>
<p>To print references, including the text they refer to, type Ctrl+P or choose
menu File - Print. Follow the screen.</p>
<h3><a name="howtogobacktoanoriginalreference"></a>How to go back to an original reference?</h3>
<p>When working in a text and going to another reference, it is important to
have a way to go back to the original reference.</p>
<p>The Previous/Next in the toolbar (green arrows to the left/right) can be
used to go to the the original reference in the Text Area. This is the text
before any reference of the Reference Area was activated.</p>
