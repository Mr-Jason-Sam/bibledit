<h2><a name="massupdatingbiblenotes"></a>Mass Updating Bible Notes</h2>
<p>Opinions vary on whether origin references in footnotes and
crossreferences are useful. Some say that they are useful because they
indicate the verse to which the note belongs. Others say that these
references are just clutter and that the information is clearer without
them.</p>
<p>A tool is available that can add or remove the origin references of all
the Bible Notes in one go.</p>
<p>See the USFM documentation for <a href="usfm_notes.html">footnotes,
endnotes</a> and <a href="usfm_xrefs.html">crossreferences</a> for a
description of what the origin references are.</p>
<p>In the dialog, tick what type of notes to affect: footnotes, endnotes,
crossreferences, or a combination of them. If you tick "Footnotes", for
example, and leave the others unticked, then only the footnotes in your
project will be affected.</p>
<p>Then choose the action you wish to take, whether to give statistics only,
or whether to add the origin references or to remove them.</p>
<p>If you add them, you can set how the origin references will look.</p>
<p>Once all settings are made, press OK to process all verses in your
project.</p>
<p>Changes that Bibledit will now make cannot be made undone.</p>
<p>Statistics of what has been found and what has been done will be given
once through.</p>
<p>Sometimes Bible notes don't have any markers in them at all, they are just
plain text. To add the default markers to the note, choose option "Add
missing text labels".</p>
