<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bibledit offers the option to work with source languages.</p>
<p>Basically the source languages of the Bible are Hebrew, a bit of Aramaic,
which is dealt with as part of Hebrew, and Greek. Where data about the source
languages is freely available, Bibledit aims to offer it to the user as an aid
in the Bible translation work.</p>
<p>Source languages can also be in another language than Hebrew or Greek. If
such languages are tagged with information referring to the Hebrew or Greek,
then such languages are also regarded as source languages. For example,
Bibledit offers the King James Bible with Strong's lemmata and morphology.</p>
<p>Source languages are accessible through menu View / Source languages.</p>
<p>The source languages window behaves as if it is a web page. Links are
indicated, and if these are clicked, actions take place.</p>
