<h2><a name="thedata"></a>The data</h2>

<p>Your data is valuable. If your data consists of a Bible that you translate,
many years of work may have gone into it. It deserves maximum safety.</p>

<p>Bibledit offers a variety of mechanisms that deal with your data.</p>

<p>First there is the mechanism of "Backup". A backup makes an exact copy of
your data and stores it onto some medium.</p>

<p>A "Restore" is the opposite of a backup. It takes that backup that was made
earlier, and restores it into your data.</p>

<p>Then, there's "Import". It takes data in another format, and adds it to your
own data.</p>

<p>Finally, there's "Export". It is the opposite of an import. It takes your
data and exports it into another format.</p>

<p>More information is available below.</p>
