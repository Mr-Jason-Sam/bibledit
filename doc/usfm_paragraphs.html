\s The Preaching of John the Baptist
\r (Matthew 3.1-12; Luke 3.1-18; John 1.19-28)
\p
\v 1 This is the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
\v 2 It began as the prophet Isaiah had written:
\q1 ?God said, ?I will send my messenger ahead of you
\q2 to open the way for you.?
\q1
\v 3 Someone is shouting in the desert,
\q2 ?Get the road ready for the Lord;
\q2 make a straight path for him to travel!??
\p
\v 4 So John appeared in the desert, baptizing and preaching.
?Turn away from your sins and be baptized,?</pre>
<h3><a name="m"></a>m</h3>
<p>\m(_Sample text...)</p>

<p>Example of use (TEV 1Co 1.20):</p>
<pre>\v 18 For the message about Christ's death on the cross is
nonsense to those who are being lost; but for us who are being
saved it is God's power.
\v 19 \x - \xo 1.19: \xt Isa 29.14 (LXX).\x* The scripture says,
\q1 ?I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
\q2 and set aside the understanding of the scholars.?
\b
\m
\v 20 So then, where does that leave the wise? or the scholars?
or the skillful debaters of this world? God has shown that this
world's wisdom is foolishness!
\p
\v 21 \x - \xo 1.21: \xdc Ws 13.1-9.\x* For God in his wisdom made
it impossible for people to know him by means of their own wisdom.</pre>

And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.
\li1

to separate water from water.?

expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
