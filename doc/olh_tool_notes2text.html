<h2><a name="transferprojectnotestotext"></a>Transfer Project Notes to text</h2>
<p>The tool can be accessed through menu / Tools / Transfer project notes to
text.</p>
<p>This tool does only one thing. It copies the project notes into the
currently opened project.</p>
<p>It does that by going through each verse of the project that is now opened
in the editor. At each verse it looks at which project notes would display if
that verse were visible in the editor. It then copies the text of those notes
into the text of the project. It the text of a note is copied into the
project, it does not overwrite the data that is already in the project, but
it just appends it.</p>
<p>This tool can be useful in cases that somebody wishes to have some way of
printing a subset of project notes along with the text, so that checking
questions could be printed on the same page as the verses they refer to. To
do this, the notes can be imported in some temporal project, and then a
"Parallel Bible" could be created that includes that temporal project that
now contains the notes.</p>
