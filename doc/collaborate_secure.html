<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Secure collaboration is necessary when your data travels through the public
internet, or when your repository is on the internet. Only those who have the
keys to a secure repository have access to it, nobody else. Data will be
encrypted and transported securely. Nobody can see the data that is being
transported.</p>
<p>An example will be used to show how to set up this type of secure
collaboration. The example uses a git repository on sourceforge.net.</p>
<h3><a name="sourceforgeaccounts"></a>Sourceforge accounts</h3>
<p>Open an account on sourceforge.net. We will use the username "joe" in this
example.</p>
<p>Register a new project on sourceforge.net. Let's call this project
"repo1".</p>
<p>Enable project feature "Git" on this project.</p>
<h3><a name="thekeys"></a>The keys</h3>
<p>Bibledit needs to be able to access the repository securely and without any
required user intervention such as requests for passwords. To make a secure
connection to the repository without asking for a password, you need to
generate a pair of keys without a passphrase. Let's go ahead and generate a key
pair. On your Linux workstation, open a termial and enter the following:</p>
<pre>ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -f ~/.ssh/ssh-key</pre>
<p>It will respond as follows:</p>
<pre>Generating public/private dsa key pair.</pre>
<pre>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</pre>
<p>At this stage press Enter. It will continue as follows:</p>
<pre>Enter same passphrase again:</pre>
<p>Press Enter again. It will continue as below:</p>
<pre>Your identification has been saved in /home/joe/.ssh/ssh-key.</pre>
<pre>Your public key has been saved in /home/joe/.ssh/ssh-key.pub.</pre>
<p>It will print some more lines of text. This is not relevant for our
purpose.</p>
<p>This pair of keys is important. There is the private key, in a file called
"ssh-key", and the public key, in another file called "ssh-key.pub". Store them
safely.</p>
<p>On your personal account page at sourceforge.net, choose Services, then
choose "Edit SSH Keys for Shell/CVS". Open the file "ssh-key.pub" in gedit.
Select all the text and copy it to the clipboard. In the screen titled "SSH
Keys", there is a place where it says "Authorized keys:". Paste the text from
gedit into the space on the web page. After checking that everything looks
fine, press button "Update". Synchronizing the keys into the system has a 10
minute delay.</p>
<p>The next step is to tell the secure shell where to find the private key when
we connect to sourceforge.net. To do that, open file ~/.ssh/config in gedit.
Enter the entry for sourceforge.net, like so:</p>
<pre>Host *sourceforge.net</pre>
<pre>     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh-key</pre>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>If the delay of 10 minutes has expired, we can now try whether the key pair
works well. In the terminal, try to log into the shell at sourceforge:</p>
<pre>ssh joe@web.sourceforge.net</pre>
<p>If this asks for a password, then the key pair has not been setup properly.
It should not ask for a password, but welcome you, then say that the shell
account is restricted, then close the connection. If it does this, then the key
pair works fine.</p>
