<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Secure collaboration is necessary when your data travels through the public
internet, or when your repository is on the internet. Only those who have the
keys to a secure repository have access to it, nobody else. Data will be
encrypted and transported securely. Nobody can see the data that is being
transported.</p>
<p>An example will be used to show how to set up this type of secure
collaboration. The example uses a git repository on sourceforge.net.</p>
<h3><a name="sourceforgeaccounts"></a>Sourceforge accounts</h3>
<p>Open an account on sourceforge.net. We will use the username "joe" in this
example.</p>
<p>Register a new project on sourceforge.net. Let's call this project
"repo1".</p>
<p>Enable project feature "Git" on this project.</p>
<h3><a name="thekeys"></a>The keys</h3>
<p>Bibledit needs to be able to access the repository securely and without any
required user intervention such as requests for passwords. To make a secure
connection to the repository without asking for a password, you need to
generate a pair of keys without a passphrase. <a href="ssh-key-pair.html">Go
ahead and generate a key pair</a>. </p>
<p>On your personal account page at sourceforge.net, choose Services, then
choose "Edit SSH Keys for Shell/CVS". You have generated a file "ssh-key.pub".
Open it in gedit. Select all the text and copy it to the clipboard. In the
screen titled "SSH Keys", there is a place where it says "Authorized keys:".
Paste the text from gedit into the space on the web page. After checking that
everything looks fine, press button "Update". Synchronizing the keys into the
system has a 10 minute delay.</p>
<p>The next step is to tell the secure shell where to find the private key when
we connect to sourceforge.net. To do that, open file ~/.ssh/config in gedit.
Enter the entry for sourceforge.net, like so:</p>
<pre>Host *sourceforge.net</pre>
<pre>     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh-key</pre>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>The above refers to a file called "ssh-key". You have generated this key
before, as part of a secure shell key pair.</p>
<p>If the delay of 10 minutes has expired, we can now try whether the key pair
works well. In the terminal, try to log into a shell at sourceforge:</p>
<pre>ssh joe@web.sourceforge.net</pre>
<p>If it asks for a password, then the key pair has not been set up properly.
It should not ask for a password, but welcome you, then say that the shell
account is restricted, then close the connection. If it does this, then the key
pair works fine.</p>
