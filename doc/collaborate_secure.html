<h2><a name="bibledit"></a>Secure network collaboration</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Secure collaboration is necessary when your data travels through the public
internet, or when your repository is on the internet. Only those who have the
keys to a secure repository have access to it, nobody else. Data will be
encrypted and transported securely. Nobody can see the data that is being
transported.</p>

<p>An example will be used to show how to set up this type of secure
collaboration. The example uses a git repository on sourceforge.net.</p>

<h3>Repository setup</h3>

<p>Open an account on sourceforge.net. We use the username "joe" in this
example.</p>

<p>Register a new project on sourceforge.net. Let's call this project
"repo1".</p>

<p>Enable project feature "Git" on this project.</p>

<p>... Work in progress ...</p>
