<h2><a name="checkusfmwindow"></a>Check USFM Window</h2>

<p>This dialog is accessed through the menu, Checks / USFM.</p>

<p>It basically checks whether the verses are placed correctly in USFM view.</p>

<p>It can also be used for importing raw text.</p>

<p>Importing raw text is not so straight-forward. The text usually comes from a
typist who has typed a bit of an existing Bible. This text is supposed to be
entered in Bibledit for further processing. The text that is produced by the
typist usually contains a number of errors. This makes a bit of tweaking needed
when importing this text.</p>

<p>The steps to take are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Paste one chapter of the typed text into the plain USFM editor.</p>

<p>2. Press button "Discover markup".</p>

<p>3. Look at the bottom of the screen for information about what to
correct.</p>

<p>4. Once all is fine, press OK to import the chapter.</p>

<p>At the end of all, when all text has been imported, chapter 0 needs to be
set as well, else without that Bibledit won't work well with the imported text.
Setting chapter 0 is usually done by simply applying the "c" marker in the
editor, choosing chapter 0, and pressing OK.</p>

<p>Note. At any stage in the text import process, the user can filter the text.
Select the filter to apply, then click button "Filter text". Filters can be
created through menu <a href="olh_preferences_filters.html">Preferences /
Filters</a>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>There is an option "Verses are at line start". if this one is ticked, when
discovering the markup, the engine only considers verses that are at the start
of the line. Or to put it more correctly, it only considers the first number in
a paragraph to be a verse, and skips any following numbers.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>In some raw text footnotes or cross references are included in the text. See
the following example, where one would like to import the following raw
text:</p>

<p>"5 Don't forget what happened to those people that the Lord rescued from
Egypt. Some of them did not have faith, and he later destroyed them. Ex 12.51;
Nu 14.29,30. 6 You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left
their proper places. God chained them with everlasting chains and is now
keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment."</p>

<p>There is a cross reference in 5: Ex 12.51; Nu 14.29,30.</p>

<p>To import this raw text properly, you need to tick the option that the verse
numbers are at the start of the line. Then recognize the text by clicking on
the button. It will now have recognized only verse 5. You need to put a new
line before verse 6, and manually add the \v before it. The switch to formatted
view, and cut the cross reference to the clipboard. Then insert a new cross
reference, and paste that text into the dialog.</p>
