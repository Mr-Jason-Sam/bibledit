<h2><a name="checkusfmwindow"></a>Check USFM Window</h2>
<p>This dialog is accessed through the menu, Checks / USFM.</p>
<p>It basically checks whether the verses are placed correctly in USFM view.</p>
<p>It can also be used for importing raw text.</p>
<p>Importing raw text is not so straight-forward. The text usually comes from a
typist who has typed a bit of an existing Bible. This text is supposed to be
entered in Bibledit for further processing. The text that is produced by the
typist usually contains a number of errors. This makes a bit of tweaking needed
when importing this text.</p>
<p>The steps to take are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Paste one chapter of the typed text into the plain USFM editor.</p>
<p>2. Press button "Discover markup".</p>
<p>3. Look at the bottom of the screen for information about what to
correct.</p>
<p>4. Once all is fine, press OK to import the chapter.</p>
<p>At the end of all, when all text has been imported, chapter 0 needs to be
set as well, else without that Bibledit won't work well with the imported text.
Setting chapter 0 is usually done by simply applying the "c" marker in the
editor, choosing chapter 0, and pressing OK.</p>
<p>Note. At any stage in the text import process, the user can filter the text.
Select the filter to apply, then click button "Filter text". Filters can be
created through menu <a href="olh_preferences_filters.html">Preferences /
Filters</a>.</p>
<p>Note. There is an option "Text is okay". If this is ticked, even if Bibledit
thinks that the text is not okay, it still would allow you to import it, as if
the text were fine.</p>
<p>Note. There is an option "Verses are at line start". if this one is ticked,
when discovering the markup, the engine only considers verses that are at the
start of the line. Or to put it more correctly, it only considers the first
number in a paragraph to be a verse, and skips any following numbers.</p>
