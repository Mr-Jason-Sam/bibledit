<p>There are <a href="accelerators.html">keyboard accelerators</a> for moving
to the next or previous verse, chapter or book. There is also a toolbar with
controls for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If going to a next verse, but Bibledit is already at the last verse of a
chapter, it will then go to the first verse of the next chapter. Same for the
next chapter, if Bibledit is at the last one of a book, it will go to the first
one of the next book.</p>

<p>Left on the toolbar there are two arrows. The left arrow takes you to the
place in the Bible that you have recently viewed. The right arrow will take you
back to where you came from. You can click an arrow several times, if you have
viewed enough places.</p>

<p>There is also a keyboard accelerator for going to any Bible reference. This
is Ctrl-G. The "G" stands for "Go to". It accepts many different forms of a
Bible reference. If the editor displays Matthew 1:10, for example, and the user
enters "11", it will go to the next verse. If "2:3" is entered, or "2 3", then
the editor will go to Matthew 2:3. If "Gen 1:10" is entered, it will go to
Genesis 1:10. And so forth.</p>

<p>Bibledit can remember the most recent verse per chapter, and the most recent
chapter per book. This is supposed to assist with the navigation through the
Bible and make it faster. It should be enabled <a
href="olh_preferences_gui.html">in the User interface options</a>.</p>

<p>To move the keyboard focus to a text editor press F5.</p>

<p>Shift+F5 takes you to one of the tools windows. Pressing it repeatedly
focuses all open tool windows in sequence.</p>

<p>Ctrl+F5 goes to the project notes window<a href="areas.html">.</a></p>

<p>Repeatedly pressing the Tab key moves between all windows counter-clockwise,
and Shift+Tab moves the focus between the windows clockwise.</p>

<p>Moving with the Up/Down arrow key to a certain verse and then use Alt-Left
arrow key jumps back to the verse you started to move from. If you use the
Up/Down arrow key several time you can use the Alt-Left arrow key also several
times. The Alt-Right arrow key works too. It goes in the history to the next in
a whole series of moves.</p>

<p>Bibledit can automatically send references to other programs: <a
href="xiphos.html">Xiphos</a>, <a href="bart.html">BART</a>, <a
href="translators_workplace.html">Translator's Workplace</a>, <a
href="bibletime.html">BibleTime</a>, <a href="bibleworks.html">BibleWorks</a>,
the <a href="onlinebible.html">Online Bible</a>. It can also manually receive
references from these programs. To receive references, in menu Preferences /
"Reference exchange" choose what program to receive from, and then go to Tools
/ "Receive reference" to actually receive the it. With the Online Bible it
works as from version 3.95.01.</p>

<p>It also shares word references with <a href="toolbox.html">Toolbox</a>.</p>
