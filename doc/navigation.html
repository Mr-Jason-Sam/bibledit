<p>There are keyboard shortcuts for moving to the next or previous verse,
chapter or book. These shortcuts can be found in menu Goto. There is also a
toolbar with controls for the same purpose.</p>
<p>If going to a next verse, but Bibledit is already at the last verse of a
chapter, it will then go to the first verse of the next chapter. Same for the
next chapter, if Bibledit is at the last one of a book, it will go to the
first one of the next book.</p>
<p>Left on the toolbar there are two arrows. The left arrow takes you to the
place in the Bible that you have recently viewed. The right arrow will take
you back to where you came from. You can click an arrow several times, if you
have viewed enough places.</p>
<p>There is also a shortcut for going to any Bible reference. See the menu.
It accepts many different forms of a Bible reference. If the editor displays
Matthew 1:10, for example, and the user enters "11", it will go to the next
verse. If "2:3" is entered, or "2 3", then the editor will go to Matthew 2:3.
If "Gen 1:10" is entered, it will go to Genesis 1:10. And so forth.</p>
<p>To move the keyboard focus to the <a href="areas.html">Text Area</a>,
press F5.</p>
<p>Shift+Ctrl+F5 goes to the <a href="areas.html">Bible Notes Area.</a></p>
<p>Shift+F5 takes you to the <a href="areas.html">Tools Area</a>. This also
toggles between the areas contained in the Tools Area.</p>
<p>* Shift+F5 (first time) activates the visible area.</p>
<p>* Shift+F5 (a second time) switches to the next one.</p>
<p>Ctrl+F5 goes to the <a href="areas.html">Project Notes Area.</a></p>
<p>Repeatedly pressing the Tab key moves between all areas counter-clockwise,
and Shift+Tab moves the focus between the areas clockwise, with the exception
when moving from text area to references area. In this case Shift+Tab has to
be used twice, as using it once goes to the verse box of the toolbar.</p>
<p>Moving with the Up/Down arrow key to a certain verse and then use Alt-Left
arrow key jumps back to the verse you started to move from. If you use the
Up/Down arrow key several time you can use the Alt-Left arrow key also
several times. The Alt-Right arrow key works too. It goes in the history to
the next in a whole series of moves.</p>
