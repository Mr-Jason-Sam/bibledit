<p>The dialog is accessible through menu Preferences / Filters.</p>
<h3><a name="general"></a>General</h3>
<p>It creates, edits and deletes filters.</p>
<p>Creating a new filter is simple. Just press button "New", type a name for
the filter, choose the type of the filter, and press OK.</p>
<p>Deleting an existing filter is simple too. Select the filter, then press
"Delete".</p>
<p>Editing a filter is another simple matter. Select the filter, and type the
rules in the Rules window. More about the rules later on.</p>
<p>A filter can be tried out. Press the "Try" button to do that. The text at
the left of the button is passed through the filter, and then becomes visible
at the right side. Any errors show up there too. The text at the left of the
button can be changed to anything.</p>
<h3><a name="rules"></a>Rules</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of the filter, there are various programs that run
the rules.</p>
<h4><a name="sedrules"></a>Sed rules</h4>
<p>The program "sed" is used for operating the filter. Sed is a Stream
EDitor. It takes the input text, passes it through one or more rules, and
then outputs it, modifying it on the fly. The modifications are done
according to the rules that have been given.</p>
<p>More help about creating rules is in the <a
href="sed_rules_reference.html">sed rules</a> reference, and in the <a
href="regular_expressions_reference.html">regular expressions</a> reference.
A wealth of information about sed, and the rules to write, is available at <a
href="http://sed.sourceforge.net/">sed.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="teckitmapping"></a>TECkit mapping</h4>
<p>The TECkit package is used for running the filter. TECkit is a toolkit for
conversion of data to Unicode. Bibledit uses it only for converting Unicode
to Unicode. The package takes the input text, passes it through a set of
mapping rules, and then outputs it, modifying it on the fly.</p>
<p>More help about creating the mapping rules is in the <a
href="teckit_mapping_rules_reference.html">TECkit mapping rules</a>
reference. More information is available from SIL through the <a
href="http://www.sil.org/computing/index.html">computing index</a>, or more
specifically at the <a
href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;cat_id=TECkit">TECkit
home page</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="freescript"></a>Free script</h4>
<p>A free script is used for running the filter. A free script means any
script that you can give and that will run in the shell. Here is an example
of a very basic script, one that really doesn't filter at all, it only shows
how to write a script:</p>
<pre>cat inputfile &gt; outputfile</pre>
<p>Bibledit searches for a text "inputfile", and replaces that with the input
data. It also searches for text "outputfile", and replaces that with the
output data. The script then is passed to the shell, and runs there. The
output data is then read again and used.</p>
<p>The above script just takes the input file and copies that to the output
file.</p>
<p>Any custom script that you made will do here, in any language. The only
thing that is important is that the texts "inputfile" and "outputfile" are
there. And of course that the script does something sensible.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<p>While the USFM text is ran through the filter, an attempt is made that the
USFM codes themselves will not be changed. To protect these codes from being
changed, the codes are temporally changed into numbers. The assumption here
is that the user will not write filters that change numbers. After filtering
the numbers are changed back to the original USFM codes again. This process
is transparent to the user, that is, the user does not notice that it
happens. This process will work well only if the filters don't change the
numbers.</p>
