<p>This assistant can be reached through menu Preferences / Remote
repository.</p>
<p>See <a href="collaboration.html">Git</a> for information about what this
repository is used for.</p>
<h3><a name="useremoterepository"></a>Use remote repository</h3>
<p>This setting allows several people to work together on one project.</p>
<p>Several other settings have to be made, as described below.</p>
<h3><a name="tryingoutthecontenttracker"></a>Trying out the content tracker</h3>
<p>The setup assistant will test the content tracker, whether it is able to
perform everything that is needed. Normally the test passes, and you can go
forward. If the test fails, it is recommended to <a
href="install_git.html">install git from source</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="actionselector"></a>Action selector</h3>
<p>In the next page select which action you'd like to take. For a first
repository setup, the default action should be chosen.</p>
<h3><a name="repository"></a>Repository</h3>
<p>This is the path to the git repository that Bibledit is going to use. Your
system administrator should give you the path that ought to be filled in
here.</p>
<p>Example paths:</p>
<p>git://biblerepository.com/projects/myproject</p>
<p>git://localhost/repository</p>
<p>file:///home/joe/repositories/myproject</p>
<p>The protocols "git+ssh", "ssh" and "http" are not supported yet</p>
<p>The path should point to an already existing repository, created by the
system administrator.</p>
<p>If the repository has been set, the dialog will indicate whether read access
to the repository has been granted.</p>
<h3><a name="copyrepository"></a>Copy repository</h3>
<p>Press the button to copy the remote repository to the local data.</p>
<h3><a name="writeaccess"></a>Write access</h3>
<p>If write access has been granted, then things should work fine.</p>
<h3><a name="updatefrequency"></a>Update frequency</h3>
<p>You can set how often Bibledit will check the repository on the server for
updates. If this is set to 60 seconds, that means that Bibledit will contact
the server every 60 seconds, and find out whether any data has been changed by
other users. If that is the case, it will merge these changes with its own
data.</p>
<h3><a name="conflicthandling"></a>Conflict handling</h3>
<p>When two users make changes in one line in one verse, and the changes are
not compatible, then a conflict will occur. Bibledit will resolve this conflict
for you. Settings for that are made in this dialog. You can give preference to
"the local data". This means that the data of the other user is lost. Or you
can give preference to "the data in the remote repository". This means that
your own changes will be overwritten with the changes that are on the server,
which actually means that the changes the other user made overwrite your own
changes.</p>
<p>When two users make changes in different verses of the same chapter, at the
same time, Bibledit will merge those changes.</p>
<h3><a name="applyingthechanges"></a>Applying the changes</h3>
<p>Keep pressing the "Forward" button and at the end "Apply" the settings.</p>
