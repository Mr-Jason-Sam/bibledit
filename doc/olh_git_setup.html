<p>This dialog can be reached through menu Preferences / Git repository.</p>
<p>See <a href="git.html">Git</a> for information about what this repository
is used for.</p>
<h2><a name="useremoterepository"></a>Use remote repository</h2>
<p>This setting allows several people to work together on one project.</p>
<p>Several other settings have to be made, as described below.</p>
<h3><a name="repository"></a>Repository</h3>
<p>This is the path to the git repository that Bibledit is going to use. Your
system administrator should give you the path that ought to be filled in
here.</p>
<p>Example paths:</p>
<p>git://biblerepository.com/projects/myproject</p>
<p>git://localhost/repository</p>
<p>file:///home/joe/repositories/myproject</p>
<p>The protocols "git+ssh", "ssh" and "http" are not supported yet</p>
<p>The path should point to an already existing repository, created by the
system administrator.</p>
<p>If the repository has been set, the dialog will indicate whether several
points about it are okay. For example, the user should have read and write
access to this repository. Keep making the settings till write access has
been granted.</p>
<h3><a name="initializingthelinktotherepository"></a>Initializing the link to the repository</h3>
<p>There are two ways to initialize the link to the repository.</p>
<p>You can copy the repository to the local data. This erases the local data
and then takes a fresh copy from the repository.</p>
<p>Or you can synchronize the local data with the remote repository. This
pulls all changes from the repository and merges that with the local data,
and then it pushes all changes of the local data into the repository.</p>
<p>Please be careful with what you choose here. Actual changes will occur at
the time of selection the option, before the OK button has been pressed.</p>
<h3><a name="updatefrequency"></a>Update frequency</h3>
<p>You can set how often Bibledit will check the repository on the server for
updates. If this is set to 60 seconds, that means that Bibledit will contact
the server every 60 seconds, and find out whether any data has been changed
by other users. If that is the case, it will merge these changes with its own
data.</p>
<h3><a name="conflicthandling"></a>Conflict handling</h3>
<p>When two users make changes in one line in one verse, and the changes are
not compatible, then a conflict will occur. Bibledit will resolve this
conflict for you. Settings for that are made in this dialog. You can "take my
data". This means that the data of the other user is lost. Or you can "take
the server's data". This means that your own changes will be overwritten with
the changes that are on the server, which actually means that the changes the
other user made overwrite your own changes.</p>
<p>When two users make changes in different verses of the same chapter, at
the same time, Bibledit will merge those changes.</p>
