<h2><a name="projectproperties"></a>Project Properties</h2>

<p>In this dialog you can set the properties of a project.</p>

<p>The dialog is accessible through menu File / Project / Properties.</p>

<p>You can change the name of the project.</p>

<p>By default a project is editable, but you can set it non-editable. In that
case the project cannot be changed or deleted.</p>

<p>You can add or remove books.</p>

<p>When adding books, you can either import a book from file, or add a book
using an empty template.</p>

<p>You can set the versification system of the project, and the language.
Both of these get their data from <a
href="http://scripturechecks.sourceforge.net">http://scripturechecks.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>You can set that a project depends upon another one, and that the
dependency runs through a filter. This means that the text of the original
project is taken, runs through a filter that changes the text, and then comes
in the current project in the new form. This can be useful for creating a
diglot. The filters can be managed in menu Preferences / Filters.</p>

<p>There is also a setting for whether to check the spelling in the projects.
If this option is ticked, then one or more dictionaries should be selected
through the "Dictionaries" button.</p>
