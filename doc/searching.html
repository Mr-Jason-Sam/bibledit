<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Through menu Edit the Find menu can be opened. The same can be done
through the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F.</p>
<p>A hit-list (list of verses containing the searched item) in the
Referencess Area is created.</p>
<h3><a name="basicfind"></a>Basic Find</h3>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find (Ctrl+F) searches exacty (except case sensitive) for
the sequence of characters entered into the Search for box, punctuation marks
and spaces included. Case sensitive can be switched on or off. Searching can
be limited to the current book.</p>
<p>Example: Searching for "ue. t" (without the quotation marks) shows all the
references (in the Reference Area) with the words: true. The.</p>
<p>Note that for the text to actually display, you have to hit one of the
search results.</p>
<h3><a name="advancedfind"></a>Advanced Find</h3>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+F) allows more complex searches than the
Basic Find:</p>
<p>* Search box to enter text.</p>
<p>* Case sensitive: on or off.</p>
<p>* Search in curent book only: this limits searching to the current
book.</p>
<p>* Interprete * and ? as wildcards: on or off.</p>
<p>* Match start of word: on or off.</p>
<p>* Match end of word: on or off.</p>
<p>* Select books: some books (all), for details see <a
href="olh_selectbooks.html">Select books.</a></p>
<p>* Which area of the text to search in.</p>
<p>* What to do with the search results. This gives the choice how the
results will show up in the Reference Area, see Loading results below.</p>
<p>There are two wildcards. The ? and the *. The ? means "any single
character". If one were to search for "p?t", and ticks the option for
wildcards, then the search will hit results like "pit" and "put". The * works
similar, but means "zero or more characters".</p>
<p>Searches can be done in certain areas of the text. When searching in the
raw USFM text, then one searches in the text as it is stored, e.g. one can
search for markers too, like \add. When searching in all the text except the
USFM codes, one searches in the text as it will appear on the paper when
printed. This means that searching for markers is not possible, as these will
be hidden on the paper. When searching in certain categories, one can limit
searches to, let's say, only the introductions, or only the verse text, or
only headings and identifiers, and so forth.</p>
<h3><a name="findinbibletime"></a>Find in BibleTime</h3>
<p>When BibleTime is running, one can also search for text in BibleTime, and
the references will then be loaded straight into Bibledit.</p>
<p>The 'Search in' tool has the the following four options to search in
BibleTime:</p>
<p>* Standard Bible: This is the Bible, which is chosen as the Standard Bible
in BibleTime.</p>
<p>* Open modules: All the modules (called works in BibleTime) which are
currently open in BibleTime.</p>
<p>* Bible: Clicking on the down arrow next to it gives the choice of any
bible in Bibletime, regardless of whether it is opened or not.</p>
<p>* Commentary: Clicking on the down arrow next to it gives the choice of
any commentary in Bibletime, regardless of whether it is opened or not.</p>
<p>The 'What to do with the search results' tool gives the choice how the
results will show up in the Reference Area, see Loading results below.</p>
<h3><a name="loadingresults"></a>Loading results</h3>
<p>Once an advanced or BibleTime search has been done, one can decide how
they interact with what is already in the references area.</p>
<p>* The search results can simply be loaded in the references area, and so
replaces anything that is already there.</p>
<p>* Or the search results can be added to the references already there.</p>
<p>* Or they can be removed from the references already loaded.</p>
<p>* Sharing the search results with what is already in the references area
means that only the references that are the same will be kept in the
references area, and the other ones will be discarded.</p>
<p>In the case that in a Special Find the option: 'Share them with the ones
already in the References Area' is chosen, and this special find with this
option is repeated several times, several groups of characters can be
highlighted in the Text Area (as a result from the different searches) when a
reference is activated in the References Area.</p>
<h3><a name="findandreplace"></a>Find and Replace</h3>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find and Replace (Ctrl+R) searches for text and allows to
replace this text.</p>
<p>It consists of a:</p>
<p>* Search box to enter text: searches exacty (except case sensitive) for
the sequence of characters entered into the "Search for" box.</p>
<p>* "Replace with" box: to enter text to replace the text searched for.</p>
<p>* Case sensitive: on or off.</p>
<p>* Search in current book and/or current chapter: on or off.</p>
<p>* Select books: some books or all, for details see <a
href="olh_selectbooks.html">Select books.</a></p>
<p>After you have entered the text to find and replace and clicked on find, a
second Replace dialog opens, which gives the options:</p>
<p>* Do you with to replace this text: ... (text in unreplaced form).</p>
<p>* ... with this text? It can be edited also (suggested text in replaced
form).</p>
<p>* There are four possible responses: Yes, No, All, Cancel</p>
