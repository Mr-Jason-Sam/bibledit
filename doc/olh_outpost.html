<p>The Windows Outpost Setup dialog allows you to make various settings for
the Outpost.</p>
<h3><a name="usingwindowsoutpost"></a>Using Windows Outpost</h3>
<p>If "Use Windows Outpost" has been ticked, Bibledit will try to use the
Outpost. If you don't use the Outpost, untick this option.</p>
<p>If the Outpost is used, more settings follow below.</p>
<h3><a name="findingoutpostandwineorcrossoveroffice"></a>Finding Outpost and Wine or CrossOver Office</h3>
<p>A number of buttons are available that aid you in locating the right
version of the Outpost, and in finding the version of Wine or CrossOver
Office that Bibledit will use to run the Outpost.</p>
<p>The "Select" button allows you to select which Outpost / Wine / CrossOver
Office program to use, in case more than one was found.</p>
<p>The "Open" button allows you to manually choose a binary for Outpost /
Wine / CrossOver Office.</p>
<p>The "Find" button will search through your whole system to find programs
of Outpost / Wine / CrossOver Office. This may take a long time, depending on
the amount of data on your hard disk.</p>
<h3><a name="networkingwindowsoutpost"></a>Networking Windows Outpost</h3>
<p>Normally the Outpost runs on the same computer where Bibledit runs. But
there are cases that users wish to use resources that are installed on
another computer or on a virtual machine. To use the Outpost this way, tick
the option that the Outpost runs on another host, and enter the name of that
host. If you know the name of that host, enter it, for example "win2k"
(without the quotes). Or if you know the IP number of that host, enter
that.</p>
<p>Bibledit will now check whether that host is accessible.</p>
<p>If the Outpost runs on another host, Bibledit will not be able to
automatically start the Outpost. You need to start the Outpost manually on
that other host, and then start Bibledit. Bibledit will try to establish a
connection with it.</p>
