<h2><a name="reporting"></a>Reporting</h2>
<p>Bibledit can produce a status report. This report shows the status of that
project, that is, how much of the project has been completed.</p>
<p>There are three places in the Bibledit menu that are relevant to
reporting.</p>
<p><a href="olh_preferences_reporting.html">Preferences / Reporting</a>, for
setting the tasks assigned to the project.</p>
<p><a href="olh_edit_status.html">Edit / Status</a>, for setting which tasks
have been completed.</p>
<p>View / Status, for producing the report.</p>
<p>See each of the above three items for more information.</p>
<p>Once the report has been produced, if a task has been completed it gets a
tick (✔). If a task has not been done yet, it gets a cross (✗). If both
of these marks are given (✗ ✔), it means that the task has been partially
done.</p>
<p>The CSV export allows the user to make graphs that look better than the
ones that come with Bibledit.</p>
