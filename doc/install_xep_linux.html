<p>A Sun Java virtual machine is needed. You can see in Bibledit whether a
correct version of Java is already present. In Bibledit, go to menu
Preferences - Formatter. If the first line, about Java, says "Done", then
Java is fine. You can proceed with XEP. If it says "To do", you will need to
install Java as described below.</p>
<p>Download a Sun Java virtual machine from <a
href="http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp.</a></p>
<p>Choose the "Linux (self extracting file)", which gives a file called
jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin or a higher version</p>
<p>Put it in the home directory.</p>
<p>In the terminal, to verify the package is there, type</p>
<pre>ls</pre>
<p>To install the package, type</p>
<pre>sh jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</pre>
<p>Agree to the license and complete installing Java.</p>
<p>Make a note of the directory where Java got installed. In this case this
is ~/jre1.5.0_06</p>
<p>Note. If you install it in the directory given above, then Bibledit will
find Java automatically. If you install it elsewhere, you need to enter the
path to Java by hand.</p>
<p>Note. Some Linux distributions come with their own version of Java
installed. It may be quite a hassle to find out where this version of Java
has been installed, and so it may be difficult to locate it in Bibledit. In
case you encounter trouble to find that directory, it will be easier to just
download the Java version as described above, and install it following the
instructions. And moreover, the GNU version of Java, gij, is not enough for
XEP. Hence, if this version comes with your Linux distribution, you still
need to install the one from Sun.</p>
