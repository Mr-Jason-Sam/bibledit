<p>There is a dialog where the features of Bibledit can be set. This dialog
is accessible through menu Preferences / Features.</p>
<p>Bibledit can be set to be a more advanced tool, or a tool with fewer
options. In this way the features that Bibledit offers can be tailored to the
user's needs. There are various settings for this. These are described
below.</p>
<h3><a name="onlythebasicsareavailable"></a>Only the basics are available</h3>
<p>When Bibledit is set with only the basics available, it becomes a very
simple Bible editor. It has all user defined features switched off. See below
for the user defined features.</p>
<h3><a name="fullfeaturesareavailable"></a>Full features are available</h3>
<p>When Bibledit is set with all features available, it becomes a most
powerful Bible editor.</p>
<h3><a name="userdefinedfeatures"></a>User defined features</h3>
<p>When Bibledit is set with user defined features, then the user can set
which of the features are to be switched on.</p>
<p>If for example all features are ticked, except of "Project management",
then the user cannot manage a project, that is, the user cannot change
projects, add or delete them.</p>
<p>If for example the "Project notes" are unticked, then the user cannot view
or edit project notes.</p>
<p>There is a whole lot of other features that can be switched on or off. The
best way to see how this works is just switch these off or on and see for
yourself how Bibledit looks.</p>
