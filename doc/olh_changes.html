<h2><a name="changes"></a>Changes</h2>

<p>The assistant for viewing changes in a project is accessible through menu
File / Project / Changes.</p>

<p>It can show you the changes that have been made in the project.</p>

<p>1. You can view the changes since your last review.</p>

<p>2. You can view the changes made a date and time to be chosen by you.</p>

<p>3. You can view the changes that have been made between two dates and
times to be chosen by you.</p>

<p>After pressing Apply, some processing will be done and then the changes
will be presented to you.</p>

<p>Note. If a change is made in the text, and the changes are requested
straight after that, the change may not have been recorded yet. In that case
wait a short while and do it again.</p>
