<h2><a name="changes"></a>Changes</h2>

<p>The dialog for viewing changes in a project is accessible through menu
File / Project / Changes.</p>

<p>This feature shows you the changes made in a project since a certain date
and time.</p>

<p>You can view changes since the last review done at a certain date and
time. This is the first option in the dialog. The date and time displayed
there is automatically taken from the last time you viewed the changes
through this first option.</p>

<p>The second option is to view changes made in the project since a date and
time to be chosen by you.</p>

<p>After pressing Ok, some processing will be done and then the changes will
be presented to you.</p>

<p>Note. If a change is made in the text, and the changes are requested
straight after that, the change may not have been recorded yet. In that case
wait a short while and do it again.</p>
