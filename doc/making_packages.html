quicker and easier.</p>
<p>Below you'll find steps to follow to create packages for Bibledit and its
dependencies.</p>
<p>Ensure you have package "checkinstall" installed.</p>

<h3><a name="bibledit"></a>Bibledit</h3>
<p>To make a package for Bibledit, follow these steps.</p>
<p>Enter the directory of the bibledit package, by typing</p>
<pre>cd
cd bibledit-x.x</pre>
<p>To start making a package, type</p>
<pre>sudo /usr/local/sbin/checkinstall</pre>
<p>Answer all the questions that checkinstall asks you. Of importance is that

been stored.</p>

<p>To install that package, type</p>
<pre>cd
sudo rpm -Uhv bibledit-x.x.x-1.i386.rpm</pre>
<p>If all went fine, that means the package is ready.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<p>The instructions speak about RPM packages. But checkinstall can also make
Slackware and Debian packages. And Debian packages are supposed to work on
Ubuntu too. </p>
