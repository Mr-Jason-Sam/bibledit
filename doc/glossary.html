<h3><a name="x11"></a>X11</h3>
<p>X11 is a windowing system that runs on many platforms. It's like another
layer of the operating system. Bibledit was built to run in X11 instead of
directly in the operating system so that it would be more
platform-independent.</p>
<h3><a name="xcodetools"></a>XCode Tools</h3>
<p>Mac OS X Xcode Tools are a suite of tools for developing software on the
Mac. They are needed in order to build Bibledit from the pieces provided in
this download.</p>
<h3><a name="darwinportsmacports"></a>DarwinPorts (MacPorts)</h3>
<p>MacPorts is a tool for downloading and building software packages from the
Internet. It is needed for getting other packages that are part of the
Bibledit installation. If you have another tool you are comfortable with,
such as Fink, you could use that instead. This is done at your own risk and
is not supported.</p>
<h3><a name="gtk"></a>Gtk</h3>
<p>Gtk2 provides graphical functions that Bibledit uses to build its
interface.</p>
<h3><a name="xep"></a>XEP</h3>
<p>RenderX XEP Desktop is a commercial proprietary formatter. A free personal
edition is available. Bibledit needs it for the printing functions. See also
<a href="xep_bugs.html">XEP bugs.</a></p>
<h3><a name="sqlite"></a>Sqlite</h3>
<p>Sqlite3 provices database functionality, which Bibledit uses internally
for storing all kinds of data.</p>
<h3><a name="endnote"></a>Endnote</h3>
<p>An endnote is a footnote which is intended to be printed at the end of the
book, or perhaps even at the end of the entire body of Scripture text being
typeset. There could be many notes marked this way. Some translations might
choose to set some notes as typcial footnotes, and others as endnotes. Some
versions do this in order to distingush between "essential"
textual/translation notes (marked as footnotes), and other less critical
notes (marked as endnotes).</p>
<p>Looking at e.g. the UK CEV, one might get the impression, that footnotes
are explanations of background to a passage and endnotes concern textual
variants and choices.</p>
<h3><a name="reference"></a>Reference</h3>
<p>A reference refers to a Bible verse. It consists of a a book abreviation,
taken from the Biblical book abbreviations list, and a chapter number, and a
verse number. The verse can be a single number, or combined numbers.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Genesis 10:5</p>
<p>Matthew 5:6,7</p>
<p>Mark 2:1-3a</p>
<h3><a name="usfm"></a>USFM</h3>
<p>USFM means Unified Standard Format Marker. This is a text format common in
Bible translation.</p>
