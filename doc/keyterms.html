<h2><a name="keyterms"></a>Key Terms</h2>

<h3><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h3>

<p>To start checking terms in Bibledit, in the Checking menu choose Key
terms.</p>

<p>The layout of the screen will change a bit allowing you to easily check
certain terms.</p>

<p>Let's, for example, do a check for the word "Abba".</p>

<p>As soon as you have chosen the terms checking function, the "Keyterm" entry
is in focus, and you can start typing keyterms.</p>

<p>While you type "Abba", you will see the list of keyterms getting smaller and
smaller, till only Abba and a few other terms are displayed.</p>

<p>At this stage press Enter, and this focuses the list of keyterms that
somehow are related to Abba.</p>

<p>Move the up and down keys till the word you wish to check, Abba, is
highlighted.</p>

<p>Once you have got the right word, press Enter.</p>

<p>You will now see several things happen.</p>

<p>* Extra information about "Abba" becomes visible below the list of
keyterms.</p>

<p>* Still further down a list of approved renderings for "Abba" is loaded.
Initially this list is empty.</p>

<p>* At the bottom of the screen, you find all texts loaded that have this
keyterm.</p>

<p>Texts that do not have a correct rendering for "Abba" are displayed in red,
and texts that do have a correct rendering are displayed normally with the
correct renderings marked.</p>

<p>To add a rendering, click once on &lt;Enter a new rendering here&gt;, and
then press Enter. Type the word, e.g. "Abba", and press Enter. You'll find
that, if this rendering is found in the texts, it shows it.</p>

<p>A faster way of adding renderings is just to double-click on the word in the
text you'd like to add. The rendering will be added as a whole word, and if
there was any capital in the word, the case sensitive option will be set
too.</p>

<p>Or if you wish to add a rendering that is not a whole word, select the part
of text you'd like to add, and press Ctrl-C or choose menu Edit / Copy.</p>

<p>In the renderings you can set whether a rendering is supposed to be a whole
word, and whether the word is case sensitive.</p>

<p>To remove a rendering from the list, click once on the word to be removed,
then press Enter, remove the word, and press Enter again.</p>

<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>

<p>- The keywords are divided into collections. If you select a particular
collection, then the keyterms in the other collections are not displayed. To
see all available keywords, choose "All collections".</p>

<p>- The renderings are stored in the project.</p>

<p>- If the user types or clicks in a certain verse, the editor will also
display that verse.</p>

<p>- The database produced by the <a href="http://www.ktbh-team.org">"Key Terms
in Biblical Hebrew" project</a> is supported too. It is included with bibledit.
If an update is available, you can import it through the Import function.</p>

<p>- If renderings have been entered for a keyterm, then typing that rendering
in the "Keyterm" entry will show the original keyterm.</p>

<p>- It is possible to have the keyterms in the active verse show up while you
are translating. The renderings, if any have been entered, will show up too.
This will help the translator, so that he can choose the same rendering if the
same keyterms occurs in that verse. To show the keyterms, choose menu View /
Keyterms in verse.</p>

<p>- New keyterms can be <a href="olh_importkeyterms.html">imported</a>, and
existing collections of them can be <a
href="olh_deletekeyterms.html">deleted</a>.</p>
