<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Creating a new resource can be done through menu File / Resources / New.
</p>
<p>Editing an existing resource goes through menu File / Resources / Edit.</p>
<p>Creating new resources is described below. Editing them works
similarly.</p>
<h3><a name="creatingaresource"></a>Creating a resource</h3>
<p>When creating a new resource, several settings will have to be made about
how this new resource operates. These are described below. Not all of the
settings described below will be used at any time. The settings that are
relevant depend on the type of the resource..</p>
<h4><a name="type"></a>Type</h4>
<p>The first thing to be done when creating a new resource template is
choosing what the type of this resource will be. There are some types
supported. If the type that you need is not in the list, please describe your
resource to the developer, so that type can then be supported. Here follows a
description of some types.</p>
<p>- "Data lives somewhere else, retrieve a different URL for each verse".
This type of resource is typically used for displaying a web site as a
resource in Bibledit. Each verse retrieves a different URL from the web
site.</p>
<p>- "Produce a different index file on the fly for each verse with different
anchors". This type of resource lets Bibledit create a new index.html file
for each verse. There is a list of books for in the filenames and there is
another list of books for in the anchors.</p>
<p>- "Based upon ...". This type, if selected, lets the new resource base
itself on an existing one. This comes in useful for creating several
resources that differ only slightly in details.</p>
<h4><a name="title"></a>Title</h4>
<p>The user can enter the title of the resource. This title is used for easy
reference to the resource.</p>
<h4><a name="addingfiles"></a>Adding files</h4>
<p>A resource, if it does not live on the network, can have several files
that belong to this resource. These files make up the body of the text of the
resources, that is, these files are the actual pages to be displayed. Files
can be added to this resource by pressing the button to add files.</p>
<h4><a name="addingdirectories"></a>Adding directories</h4>
<p>In the same way as adding files, the user can add complete directories
too. The whole directory will be added and everything that it contains.</p>
<h4><a name="homepage"></a>Home page</h4>
<p>There is a "Home" button visible when a resource is displayed. If this
button is clicked, then the home page as given will be displayed. Sample home
pages: </p>
<p>- "http://www.bible.org".</p>
<p>- "index.html. This shows the file "index.html" within the files that
belong to this resource.</p>
<h4><a name="urlconstructor"></a>URL constructor</h4>
<p>In resources types where a URL must be retrieved, this URL constructor is
used to assemble the URL to be retrieved. An example of such a constructor is
http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=&lt;book&gt;&amp;chapter=&lt;chapter&gt;&amp;verse=&lt;verse&gt;.
You find text like &lt;book&gt;, &lt;chapter&gt; and &lt;verse&gt; in this
URL constructor. The text &lt;book&gt; will be replaced with the name of the
book, and &lt;chapter&gt; will be replaced with the chapter number, and so
on. So that, for example, if Bibledit displays Matthew 5:8, the URL of the
above example would become
http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Matthew&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=8.
Bibledit constructs this URL, and retrieves it, and then displays it.</p>
<h4><a name="indexfileconstructor"></a>Index file constructor</h4>
<p>The index file constructor works similar to the URL constructor. Some
resource types need the URL constructor, and other types need the index file
constructor. Here is an example of the index file constructor:</p>
<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;NET
Bible&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;frameset rows="*,150"&gt;&lt;frame
src="&lt;book&gt;&lt;chapter&gt;.htm#&lt;bookanchor&gt;
&lt;chapter&gt;:&lt;verse&gt;" name="text_pane" marginwidth="10"
marginheight="20" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;frame
src="noteintr.htm" name="note_pane" marginwidth="10" marginheight="5"
scrolling="auto" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/frameset&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>Note that this should be a complete html page. Each verse that Bibledit
goes to creates a completely new index file on the fly, and this index file
will be loaded and become visible as a Resource. The text &lt;chapter&gt;
will be replaced with the chapter number, and so also for the &lt;book&gt;
and the &lt;verse&gt;.</p>
<h4><a name="booknamesfortheconstructor"></a>Book names for the constructor</h4>
<p>There is a button there. If pressed, the user can enter names for each of
the books. For example if the user enters "mat" for the book of Matthew, then
in the constructor the book of Matthew will be given as "Mat" for the anchor.
This text substitution will only be done for "&lt;bookanchor&gt;", not for
the ordinary "&lt;book&gt;".</p>
<h4><a name="testingbooks"></a>Testing books</h4>
<p>If this button is pressed, all of the available books will be loaded in a
browser in sequence. The user can then see in a simple way if the book names
for use in the constructor have been entered properly. There is a checkbutton
that says "Books are okay". If the resource has been created and you are
happy with it, this button should be checked so as to approve of the books
entered.</p>
<h4><a name="booknamesfortheanchors"></a>Book names for the anchors</h4>
<p>There is a button there. If pressed, the user can enter names for each of
the books. For example if the user enters "Mat" for the book of Matthew, then
in the constructor the book of Matthew will be given as "Mat" where used for
anchors. The anchors are needed so that bibledit can find where a certain
verse of a certain chapter starts.</p>
<h4><a name="testinganchors"></a>Testing anchors</h4>
<p>If this button is pressed, all of the available books will be loaded in a
browser in sequence, and of each book the first chapter will be loaded, and
it will go to verse 1, then verse 2, then verse 3. The user can then see if
the book names for use in the constructor have been entered properly, as used
for the anchors. There is a checkbutton that says "Anchors are okay". If the
resource has been created and you are happy with it, this button should be
checked so as to approve of the anchors entered.</p>
<h4><a name="writinganchors"></a>Writing anchors</h4>
<p>This button allows the user to go to the <a
href="olh_resource_converter.html">Resource Converter</a> dialog where the
required anchors are written to the files. This is only needed when the
anchors are not yet in the file.</p>
<h4><a name="ok"></a>OK</h4>
<p>At the end of all, when all settings are fine, press button OK to save the
resource. It will now be ready for use, that is, this resource can be
opened.</p>
<h3><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h3>
<p>Some examples are given below to help you quickly on the way.</p>
<h4><a name="manuallypreparingaresource"></a>Manually preparing a resource</h4>
<p>Manually preparing content is not difficult. At the start of each verse,
just insert the appropriate anchor, for example:</p>
<pre>&lt;a name="mat_1_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>Then make the appropriate settings in the dialog for this resource to
work. It's not difficult, only that it is a bit of work seeing there are so
many verses.</p>
<h4><a name="localnetbible"></a>Local NET Bible</h4>
<p>To create the NET Bible as a local resource, download the HTML frames
version from <a href="http://www.bible.org/">www.bible.org</a> and unpack the
files in some directory. Create a new resource. As the type choose "Based
upon NetBible". Add all the files of the NET Bible that were unpacked above.
Tick the books and the anchors as okay. Press OK to save this resource.</p>
<h4><a name="cambridgeparagraphbiblefromlibronix"></a>Cambridge Paragraph Bible from Libronix</h4>
<p>The Cambridge Paragraph Bible, written by F.H.A. Scrivener, including all
the footnotes and cross references, can be found in the Libronix Digital
Library System. In this example we are going to create Genesis from that book
as a resource. To do that, do the following. In the Libronix Digital Library
System, open the Cambridge Paragraph Bible written by Scrivener, and copy the
book of Genesis to a word processor. This may have to be done in stages
because when tried the last time, Libronix did not allow the whole book to be
copied at once. Save it as a .htm page, for example gen.htm. Move that file
to Linux. In Bibledit create a new resourse of type "Retrieve a different URL
for each verse". Call this resource "Cambridge Paragraph Bible". Add the file
"gen.htm" to the resource. For the home page, enter whatever you wish that
would make a nice home page. This could be, for example, a title page, or a
page made by yourself that has links to all the books. Let's enter here
"home.htm", provided that this file is made available. As the URL constructor
enter "&lt;book&gt;.htm#be_anc_&lt;chapter&gt;_&lt;verse&gt;" (without the
quotes). Then enter some book names for the constructor. After pressing the
Books button, enter "gen" for the book of Genesis (without the quotes). In
the URL constructor above, this means that "&lt;book&gt;" is replaced by
"gen", so that file "gen.htm" is loaded when we go to Genesis. After this is
done anchors for each verse need to be inserted in the file gen.htm. Press
button "Write anchors" to do that. In that dialog set the type to "Chapter
starts at a pattern, verse 1 starts at chapter, verse starts at a pattern".
Open the file gen.htm for conversion. As chapter prefix enter "&gt;", as the
chapter number choose "I, II, III", and as the suffix enter ". &lt;" (all
without the quotes). As the verse prefix enter "&gt;" and as the suffix enter
"&lt;" (without the quotes again). The verse number can be left at "1, 2, 3".
Then press the "Write" button. After done, press OK. Back in the Resource
Editor, tick "Books are okay" and "Anchors are there", and press OK. The
resource is now ready for use.</p>
<h4><a name="bibleditproject"></a>Bibledit project</h4>
<p>Projects from Bibledit can be made into a resource with little effort.
Export a couple of books to OpenDocument. Then open these in OpenOffice, and
save them as HTML Document. Then create a new resource, view at the anchors
that Bibledit placed for you, make the appropriate settings, and ready it
is.</p>
<h4><a name="usfmfiles"></a>USFM files</h4>
<p>The USFM can be imported into a Bibledit project. From the Bibledit
project resources can be made, as described above.</p>
