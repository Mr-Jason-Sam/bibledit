<h2><a name="importtextdialog"></a>Import Text Dialog</h2>

<p>This dialog is accessed through the menu, File, Project, Import.</p>

<p>Directory: Select the directory that contains the files to import.</p>

<p>File: Optionally select a compressed archive. If a compressed archive is
selected for import, Bibledit will then try to unpack this archive. If that
is successful, then the selected directory goes into the uncompressed
archive. Using the Directory button, the user can then further navigate the
archive.</p>

<p>Assign: Assign names to books that are not known to Bibledit.</p>

<p>Books: Select which books to import.</p>

<p>Unicode: Select how to convert the books that are not in Unicode
format.</p>

<p>Option Overwrite: If ticked, files that are imported can overwrite
existing data. This only works for USFM files. If for example a file is
imported that contains Genesis chapter 2 and chapter 5, then only these two
chapters will be imported, overwriting the existing chapters if they are
there. Other chapters in Genesis are not touched.</p>
