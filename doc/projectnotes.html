<h3><a name="general"></a>General</h3>

<p>During the process of translation many notes will be made that related to
the project.</p>

<p>Project notes are stored in a database, and are independent of any Bible
text. That is, whichever project is opened or closed, the notes remain the
same.</p>

<h3><a name="creatingandeditingprojectnotes"></a>Creating and editing project
notes</h3>

<p>To make a new project note press Ctrl+N.</p>

<p>To edit an existing project note click on the blue reference(s) for that
note.</p>

<p>When creating a new note or editing an existing one, the Project Notes
Area splits up into two. The left side of this is called the Project Notes
Text Area and the right side is the Project Notes Tools Area.</p>

<p>Project notes can be deleted by clicking on the blue [delete] link.</p>

<p>Some keyboard shortcuts help while editing notes. An example will show
how: The user edits the text of a project. To make a new note, he presses
Ctrl+N. He types some text in the note. If he wishes to change to category of
the note, he presses Alt+A, then Enter to open the list of categories, then
he makes a selection with Up Arrow or Down Arrow and presses Enter to confirm
the selection. If he wishes to add some references, he pressed Alt+R and
types some references. Pressing Ctrl+F5 (or twice Shift+Tab) takes him back
to the area to type the note in. Alt+O saves the note, and takes the user
back to where he was editing the text. Ctrl-I puts the text in italics,
Ctrl-B makes it bold, and Ctrl-U underlines it.</p>

<p>When a project note is being edited, the creator of the note can be
retrieved through menu View / More information on current note. Other
information about this note is visible there as well, like the date it was
created, and when it was edited.</p>

<h3><a name="findingprojectnotes"></a>Finding project notes</h3>

<p>Menu / Edit / Find in Project notes (Alt+E, N) allows to do Simple
searches in the Project Notes Area. The results (notes containing the search
text) are shown in the Project Notes Area.</p>

<p>This tool searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the sequence of
characters entered into the "Search for" box, punctuation marks and spaces
included. Case sensitive can be switched on or off.</p>

<p>The Find tool in the Notes Area uses the same dialog as Find (simple).</p>

<p>Example: Searching for 'Bible' shows all the notes (in the Project Notes
Area) with the word: Bible.</p>

<h3><a name="navigatingtothereferencesofanote"></a>Navigating to the
references of a note</h3>

<p>Project notes usually have one reference. This is the one for which the
note was created. But additional references can be added as well.</p>

<p>These references are shown attached to each note in the Project Notes
Area.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get these notes into the Reference Area.</p>

<p>1. Open a note to edit it. In the menu choose Edit - Get references from
project note.</p>

<p>2. Click on the blue word [references] of a note.</p>

<p>As a result the references will be loaded in the Reference Area. Once
there they can be activated and the text belonging to that reference will
appear in the Text Area.</p>

<h3><a
name="transferringtextfromthetextareaintotheprojectnotes"></a>Transferring
text from the Text Area into the project notes</h3>

<p>Many people have one project with the actual text, and a separate project
for their project notes. There is a historical reason for doing so. This
separate project may have checking questions, answers from native helpers, a
history of different renderings, commentary support, notes following
consultant checks, and so on.</p>

<p>It would be a lot of work to copy and paste these notes into the project
notes one verse at a time.</p>

<p>The tool "Transfer text to project", under the Tools menu, helps you with
this.</p>

<p>It transfers all text that is in the currently opened project into the
project notes.</p>

<p>It takes a good while to do this.</p>

<h3><a name="notesoverlappingchapters"></a>Notes overlapping chapters</h3>

<p>If project notes need to overlap the chapter boundaries, the reference can
be manually entered like, for example: Luke 2:2-3:3. Bibledit will divide
this into two parts: Luke 2 verse 2 to the end of the chapter, and Luke 3
verse 1 to 3.</p>

<h3><a name="showingnotes"></a>Showing notes</h3>

<p>The <a href="olh_view_project_notes.html">settings for which notes to show
and how</a> are in the View menu.</p>

<h3><a name="exportingnotes"></a>Exporting notes</h3>

<p>Project notes can be exported into some formats.</p>

<p>* Bibledit Notes version 3. This is the format used by the current version
of Bibledit. In other words, notes exported through this option can be
imported in Bibledit.</p>

<p>* ScriptureNotes version 2.0. Notes exported in this format can be
imported by Translation Notes Editor 6.0.</p>

<p>To see how these formats looks, just export some text and open the
exported text in a text editor.</p>
