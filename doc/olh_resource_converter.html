<p>Bibledit provides a tool that makes a web page fit as a <a
href="resources.html">Resource</a>.</p>
<p>The tool will add the appropriate anchors at the appropriate locations in
that web page.</p>
<p>Various buttons and settings will enable the user to write the right
anchors at the right places. These are described below.</p>
<h4><a name="resourcetype"></a>Resource type</h4>
<p>Press the "Type" button to select what type of resource conversion is to
be done.</p>
<h4><a name="openfile"></a>Open file</h4>
<p>Pressing button "Open" allows the user to open a file for conversion.</p>
<h4><a name="viewfile"></a>View file</h4>
<p>Viewing the file is important in order to find out what type of web page
it is and how the anchors should be placed. If the "View" button is pressed,
the web page opens in a web browser. Modern web browsers also allow the user
to view the source of the page. This comes in helpful because the resource
converter works with the raw text.</p>
<h4><a name="chapterdetection"></a>Chapter detection</h4>
<p>To allow the resource converter to find the places where a chapter starts,
a mechanism has been provided that takes a chapter pattern to look for. If
that particular pattern is found, the resource converter will place the
anchor there. Here is an example of a chapter starting in raw html code:</p>
<p>&lt;p class=MsoNormal
style='margin-bottom:0mm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:tyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times
New Roman","serif";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'&gt;II.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New
Roman","serif";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'&gt;Thus the heavens
and the earth were finished, and &amp;#65279 ... and so on.</p>
<p>This raw html code gives the beginning of chapter two of the book of
Genesis. It can be seen in this raw code that chapter two can be found by
looking for "&gt;II. &lt;". Chapter three would be found as "&gt;III. &lt;".
And so on. It can be seen that the prefix is "&gt;", that the chapter uses
Roman numerals, and that the suffix is ". &lt;". So then, if these values are
entered in the chapter detection pattern, things will work out fine.</p>
<h4><a name="versedetection"></a>Verse detection</h4>
<p>The verse detection works similar to the chapter detection system
described above.</p>
<h4><a name="writinganchors"></a>Writing anchors</h4>
<p>If the "Write" button is pressed, then any old anchors ever added by
Bibledit will be removed from the file that was opened, new anchors will be
written using the chapter and verse detection mechanisms, and the file will
be written to disk.</p>
