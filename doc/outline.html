<h2><a name="outline"></a>Outline</h2>
<p>Bibledit shows the outline of the book that is being edited.</p>
<p>The outline can be seen in the <a href="areas.html">Tools Area</a> under
the tab "Outline".</p>
<p>All the headers and titles that are in the book are visible there, with
the chapters and verses they start with and end with.</p>
<p>The header or title that has the cursor will be focused.</p>
<p>If you double-click on any header, or press Enter, the chapter belonging
to that will be loaded in the editor.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>- Headers and titles that are in chapter 0, that means, before chapter 1,
do not show up as such, but as chapter 0 without any verse-references.</p>
<p>- There are no heading endmarkers if the heading is followed by another
one.</p>
