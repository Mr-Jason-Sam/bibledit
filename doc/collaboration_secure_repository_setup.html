setup</h2>

<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to set up a secure network repository.</p>

<p>It uses a git repository on sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>Open an account on <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a>. We
will use the username "joe" in this tutorial.</p>

<p>Register a new project on your personal account page on sourceforge.net.
Let's call this project "repo2".</p>

<p>Enable project feature "Git" on this project. This provides the
repository.</p>

<p>The next thing is to try whether you can read the repository properly. To
try that, open a terminal and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>git ls-remote ssh://joe@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</pre>

<p>This command probably will ask for your password, and the first time it
could ask you whether you want to continue connecting. But it should show no
errors. If it completes without errors, then your secure repository works
well.</p>

<p>The repository that was created in this tutorial has the following URL:</p>
<pre>ssh://user@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</pre>

<p>The users that are going to use this repository need this URL. Where it says
"user", each user would need to fill in his own username.</p>
