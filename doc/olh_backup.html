<h2><a name="backupdialog"></a>Backup dialog</h2>
<p>This dialog is accessed through menu File / Project / Backup /
Flexible.</p>
<p>In this dialog you can make an incremental backup of your project, or a
full backup.</p>
<p>A full backup just backs up everything in the project.</p>
<p>An incremental backup only backs up the changes since a certain date and
time. Use the "Since" button to select that date or time. If no selection is
made here, then changes since the last incremental backup will be backed
up.</p>
<p>To automatically backup the changes since the last backup, no worries and
no bother, you can use menu File / Project / Backup / Incremental.</p>
