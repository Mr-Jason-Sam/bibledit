<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bibledit contains a number of tools to check the text. Most of these are
accessible through menu Check.</p>
<p>Any undesired checking results can be hidden for the future, so that they
don't appear again if the same check is ran again. To hide such a result,
right-click in the References Area, and choose "Hide from now on".</p>
<h3><a name="characterinventory"></a>Character inventory</h3>
<p>This check, accessible through the menu, Check - Characters - Inventory,
gives a list of all characters in the project, and the count of each
character.</p>
<p>Due to newline handling on Linux the character counter will only include
U+000A but not U+000D. After importing the file the U+000D completely
disappears and so will not be counted.</p>
<p>A character can occur anywhere in the output html file, depending on how
sorting is done.</p>
<p>The file will be visible in the Internet browser, which will supply its
own default font so as to ensure the character becomes visible. No particular
font is enforced.</p>
<p>The check does not handle legacy encoded data. This is because anything
with such data will be converted to Unicode when imported in Bibledit, and so
the character counting check will never encounter anything else but
Unicode.</p>
<h3><a name="comparepunctuation"></a>Compare punctuation</h3>
<p>Paratext had a check called "Compare Punctuation". How do I compare
punctuation in Bibledit?</p>
<p>Comparing punctuation in Bibledit is done through the Advanced Find
functions.</p>
<p>Open the first project, and search for e.g. a question mark. The search
results will be loaded in the References Area.</p>
<p>Open the second project, and go to advanced search, and search for the
question mark again. Remove the search results from the ones already in the
References Area. The References Area will now contain the verses that do have
the question mark in the first project, and not in the second.</p>
<p>Next do it the other way round. Search in the second project, then with
advanced search in the first. The References Area will now contain the verses
that do have the question mark in the second project, but not in the
first.</p>
<h3><a name="checkmatchingpairs"></a>Check matching pairs</h3>
<p>Checks whether punctuation that is part of a pair makes a complete pair.
For example, the opening bracket [ also needs the closing bracket ].</p>
<p>The check knows about 160 matching pairs of punctuation, and checks them
all.</p>
<p>Pairs that should not be checked can be ignored. No reports will be given
on these characters.</p>
<h3><a name="checkunwantedpatterns"></a>Check unwanted patterns</h3>
<p>This check looks for patterns that are unwanted. For example, when the
pattern " ?", that is a question mark preceded by a space, is unwanted, enter
this in the dialog box of the check, and from now on this unwanted pattern
will be reported.</p>
<h3><a name="checkunwantedwords"></a>Check unwanted words</h3>
<p>This looks for unwanted whole words in the text, and reports them when
they have been found.</p>
<p>In the dialog, you can enter a list of whole words to be looked for, one
word per line.</p>
<h3><a name="repeatingwords"></a>Repeating words</h3>
<p>This check aims to find repeating words, as sometimes, but not always,
repeating words are a mistake. For example if the text has "Jesus said said:
Whoever follows me ...", then the "said said" is a repeating word entered by
mistake. This check will find these.</p>
<p>This check will also find repeating words that are not a mistake. For
example consider this USFM text:</p>
<pre>\x - \xo 1.6: \xt Matt. 10.2; 3 John 1:1.\x*</pre>
<p>This check will say that the word "1" repeats. It does so because the
crossreference "3 John 1:1" has a repeating "1". Both chapter and verse are
1. To prevent these false hits enter an "Ignore" word of ":". If this colon
is entered in the list, it no longer will find the "1" repeating.</p>
<p>Some languages have words with reduplicated roots which could be separated
with hyphens, e.g., manuk-manuk. The check will mark "manuk" as repeating. If
the hyphen (-) is entered under the "Ignore" button, then this words will no
longer be marked as repeating.</p>
