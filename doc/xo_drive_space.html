<h2><a name="bibledit"></a>XO machine drive space</h2>

<p>On a clean machine with operating system version 703 installed, and the
G1G1 Activity Pack, the free space available on the drive can be obtained in
the terminal by typing</p>
<pre>du -h</pre>

<p>It gives that 352 Mbyte is used, and that 673 Mbyte is still available.</p>

<p>After the binary tarball of bibledit was copied and installed, the free
space was 644 Mbyte. This means that bibledit used up 29 Mbyte. If the
original tarball would have been deleted, about 13 Mbyte would have been
freed. After git-core was installed the free space was 621 Mbyte. That means
that git-core and its dependencies used up 23 Mbyte. After gtkhtml3 was
installed, the free space was 606 Mbyte. This means that the package and its
dependencies used 15 Mbyte.</p>
