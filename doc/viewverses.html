<h2><a name="viewingverses"></a>Viewing verses</h2>
<p>Bibledit can display one verse of one or more projects, all in one
window.</p>
<p>This is in short what "viewing verses" is all about.</p>
<p>The user can view verses by ticking the Verses entry in the View menu.</p>
<p>A new window displays, where the verses are displayed.</p>
<p>The window shows a "Settings" expander at the top, and white space below
that.</p>
<p>Clicking on "Settings" a few buttons appear, and a list above that. That
list might be empty, and does not show in that case.</p>
<p>Click the "Add" button to add a project.</p>
<p>Once a project has been added to the window, the verse that is now in the
editor will also show in the "Verses" window. For example, if the user is
editing Matthew 2.5, and has added project "Matthew Poole", then Matthew 2.5
from the commentary of Matthew Pools will display. Of course, this only works
if the project "Matthew Poole" is available.</p>
<p>Click the "Add" button again to add another project. And so on.</p>
<p>A project can be added more than once.</p>
<p>Select a project, or more than one, and then click the "Delete" button to
delete that project from the "Verses" window.</p>
