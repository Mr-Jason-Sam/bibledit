<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>BibleWorks is a program full of quality Bible-related resources.</p>
<p>Bibledit can send references to BibleWorks. This means that when the
translator is working in Bibledit on e.g. Mark 1:10, then BibleWorks will
show Mark 1:10 too. When the translator then goes to the next verse,
BibleWorks will do the same.</p>
<p>In menu Preferences - Reference exchange, there is an option for this.
Bibledit sends these references through Bibledit Windows Outpost. Therefore
this program needs to be installed too.</p>
<p>You can use the search functionality in BibleWorks, save the list of
references to file, and then open that file in Bibledit. In this way Bibledit
takes advantage of the searching capabilities of BibleWorks. </p>
<h3><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h3>
<p>Ensure that <a href="install_wine.html">Wine has been installed</a>
properly.</p>
<p>Ensure that <a href="install_outpost.html">Bibledit Windows Outpost has
been installed.</a></p>
<p>Insert the first CD-ROM in the drive and ensure the drive has been
mounted.</p>
<p>In the terminal type</p>
<pre>wine /media/cdrom/autorun.exe</pre>
<p>supposing that /media/cdrom is your cdrom drive.</p>
<p>Follow the installation instructions on the screen and complete the
installation. When it asks you to insert another disk, unmount the cdrom
drive, swap disks, and mount the drive again.</p>
<p>To configure BibleWorks in wine, type</p>
<pre>winecfg</pre>
<p>Wine Configuration starts at the Applications tab. Click button Add
application, and navigate to drive_c, Program Files, BibleWorks 6 (or
BibleWorks 7), and select bw600.exe (or bw700.exe), and choose Open. Set the
Windows version to either Windows 2000 or Windows XP. This is needed to
prevent a crash when BibleWorks shuts down.</p>
<p>To run BibleWorks, in the terminal type</p>
<pre>wine "c:/Program Files/BibleWorks 6/bw600.exe"</pre>
<p>(or c:/Program Files/BibleWorks 7/bw700.exe).</p>
<p>BibleWorks 6 runs fine.</p>
<p>BibleWorks 7 runs rather well, and most of the things work. Only the main
toolbar does not draw, and using Unicode in the editor seems difficult.</p>
