<h2><a name="userinterface"></a>User interface</h2>
<p>The dialog for making settings for the user interface is accessible through
menu Preferences / User interface.</p>
<h3><a name="features"></a>Features</h3>
<p>Bibledit can be set to be a more advanced tool, or a tool with fewer
options. In this way the features that Bibledit offers can be tailored to the
user's needs. There are various settings for this.</p>
<p>1. When Bibledit is set with only the basics available, it becomes a very
simple Bible editor. It has all user defined features switched off. See below
for the user defined features.</p>
<p>2. When Bibledit is set with all features available, it becomes a most
powerful Bible editor.</p>
<p>3. When Bibledit is set with user defined features, the user can set which
of the features are to be switched on.</p>
<p>If for example all features are ticked, except of "Project management", then
the user cannot manage a project, that is, the user cannot change projects, add
or delete them.</p>
<p>If for example the "Project notes" are unticked, then the user cannot view
or edit project notes.</p>
<p>There is a whole lot of other features that can be switched on or off. The
best way to see how this works is just switch these off or on and see for
yourself how Bibledit looks.</p>
<h3><a name="detachedwindows"></a>Detached windows</h3>
<p>When the box "Detached windows" is checked, all the windows are detached
from each other, and can be placed anywhere on the screen, or in any workspace.
This gives maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>When the box is unchecked, all the windows are attached together. This is
common for programs with a graphical user interface.</p>
