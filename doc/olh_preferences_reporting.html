<p>This dialog is accessible through the menu / Preferences / Reporting.</p>

<p>Bibledit supports simple project status reporting.</p>

<p>In this dialog the user can set the tasks assigned to the project. Press
button "Tasks" to access the list of tasks. By default a standard list is
provided, but the user can add and remove items, and reorder them by dragging
them to a new position.</p>

<p>The user also can set how long a task will take per chapter to complete
it. Press button "Duration" to set these values. The duration can be set as
so many days per chapter, for example 0.5 days per chapter.</p>
