<h2><a name="bibletime"></a>BibleTime</h2>
<p>If BibleTime is installed, Bibledit will detect that, and the two will
work together in harmony.</p>
<p>You can set Bibledit to send references to Bibletime. This means that when
the translator is working in Bibledit on e.g. Mark 1:10, then BibleTime will
show Mark 1:10 too. When the translator then goes to the next verse,
BibleTime will do the same.</p>
<p>In Bibledit, go to menu Preferences - Reference exchange, and set Bibledit
to send references to BibleTime.</p>
<p>You can also set Bibledit to receive references from BibleTime. If the
translator works in BibleTime, and goes to the next verse, Bibledit will do
the same.</p>
<p>This feature needs BibleTime 1.5.2 or newer.</p>
<p>Bibledit can also search in BibleTime modules.</p>
<p>BibleTime uses the SWORD engine to display its resources. Bibledit can
export a project to a SWORD module, see <a
href="project.html">Project.</a></p>
<p>For information on how to install BibleTime see the <a
href="http://www.bibletime.info">BibleTime site</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have BibleTime installed this implies you have SWORD installed
too. Anyway, here is how to <a href="install_sword.html">install
SWORD</a>.</p>
