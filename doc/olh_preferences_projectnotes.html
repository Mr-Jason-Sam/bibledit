<h2><a name="projectnotespreferences"></a>Project notes preferences</h2>

<p>The dialog can be accessed through menu Preferences - Project notes.</p>

<p>It has two tabs where settings can be made.</p>

<h3><a name="accelerators"></a>Accelerators</h3>

<p>There are four <a href="accelerators.html">accelerators</a> for inserting
standard text into a project note when it is being edited. The text that will
be inserted can be defined in this tab.</p>

<h3><a name="categories"></a>Categories</h3>

<p>Every project notes has a category assigned. The available categories can be
viewed here. New ones can be added, or categories can be deleted. The order of
the categories can be changed by draggging a category to another location,
either above it or below it. Whenever a new note is created, the category that
is at the top of the list is assigned to that note. If you'd like to assign
another category to the note when creating that note, drag the one you need to
the top of the list.</p>
