<p>This dialog is for printing a project.</p>
<p>It can be accessed through menu File / Project / Print.</p>
<h4><a name="basicoperation"></a>Basic operation</h4>
<p>Press button OK to let Bibledit generate a .pdf file with the project
data.</p>
<h4><a name="options"></a>Options</h4>
<p>It is possible to print only a part of the project. The dialog shows
whether the full project will be printed or only part of it. It does that at
the "Portion:" label. Press button "Change" to change which portion will be
printed.</p>
<p>Press "Options" to show more options.</p>
<p>Option "Write the references in the notes in full". This option scans the
text to be printed in the footnotes, the endnotes, and the crossreferences.
If it finds any references to verses of the Bible, it will include these with
the text. For example if there is a crossreference that says "Acts 10.5; 1
Joh. 1:5", then it will include the full text of these verses in that
crossreference. This can be useful for checking purposes, whether the
crossreferences are correct.</p>
