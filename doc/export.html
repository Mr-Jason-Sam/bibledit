<h3><a name="exportingaproject"></a>Exporting a project</h3>

<p>A project can be exported to other formats. See menu File - Project -
Export, and choose a format there.</p>

<h4><a name="usfm"></a>USFM</h4>

<p>This will ask you to select a directory to put all the USFM files in.
Bibledit will put one USFM file per book into that directory.</p>

<h4><a name="bibleworks"></a>BibleWorks</h4>

<p>When exporting the project to BibleWorks Version Database Compiler, a text
file is produced that can be imported in the BibleWorks Version Database
Compiler for display in BibleWorks. See the BibleWorks online help for detailed
information.</p>

<h4><a name="sword"></a>SWORD and OSIS</h4>

<p>When exporting to a SWORD module, the module is created and installed
straightaway, and can be immediately seen in for example BibleTime. Normally
Bibledit will install the SWORD module to subdirectory .sword in the home
directory, but this can be changed. Provide a name for the module and export
it. After restarting BibleTime or Xiphos or another Sword enabled Bible reader,
the module should be visible in the program.</p>

<p>Normally you can leave the settings in the dialog as they are. Changes can
be made, however.</p>

<p>Name is the name for the module. The actual name given to the module
consists of the project name plus the name given here.</p>

<p>Description is a short (1 line) description of the module, such as its
title. The actual description gets the project name prefixed.</p>

<p>About is a lengthier description and may include copyright, source, etc.
information. The actual description gets the project name prefixed.</p>

<p>LCSH is the Library of Congress Subject Heading. You may search the Library
of Congress catalog at <a
href="http://catalog.loc.gov/">http://catalog.loc.gov/</a> or use it as a guide
for determining an appropriate LCSH for books that are not in the Library of
Congress.</p>

<p>License describes the license under which the module is being
distributed.</p>

<p>Version is the module's revision number of the module. Incrementing it when
changes are made alerts users of the SWORD Installers to the presence of
updated modules. Please start with version 1.0 and increment by 0.1 for minor
updates and by larger values for more major updates such as a new text
source.</p>

<p>Language is the primary language code of the module. You can select one from
the list, in which case BibleTime correctly displays the language. Or you can
enter a language by hand, in which case BibleTime puts it under "Unknown
language". See the Ethnologue, <a
href="http://www.ethnologue.com/">http://www.ethnologue.com</a>, to find your
language, and enter the code or the name.</p>

<p>Install path is where Bibledit will install the module. This is the place
where BibleTime expects the module to be installed.</p>

<p>Module path is the directory where a zipped module will be stored. This
module is fit for immediate distribution.</p>

<p>Exporting to SWORD produces an intermediate OSIS file, which is placed in
the home directory. This file will be compiled by osis2mod, the SWORD
compiler.</p>

<h4><a name="opendocument"></a>OpenDocument</h4>

<p>This will ask you where to save the file, and then does the export. The file
can be opened in the various wordprocessors that support OpenDocument, such as
AbiWord, KWord, OpenOffice, etc. The main purpose of this export is to be able
to transfer the formatted text into other applications. For that reason several
style settings, like two columns, are unsupported.</p>

<h3><a name="links"></a>Links</h3>
