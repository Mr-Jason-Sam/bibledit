<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>You can export the data from Bibledit. All export is done from the Export
Assistant. See menu File / Export. You can export a Bible, or the References,
or a Stylesheet, among other things.</p>

<h3><a name="exportabible"></a>Export a Bible</h3>

<h4><a name="unifiedstandardformatmarker"></a>Unified Standard Format
Marker</h4>

<p>In case that you export everything, it will ask you to select a directory to
put all the USFM files in. Bibledit will put one USFM file per book into that
directory. Or if the export if compressed, all the files will be stored in a
zipped archive.</p>

<p>In case that you export only the changes, matters are slightly different.
This only exports the changes since last time you did this, or since a certain
date and time. This can be chosen.</p>

<h4><a name="bibleworksversiondatabasecompiler"></a>BibleWorks Version Database
Compiler</h4>

<p>When exporting a Bible to BibleWorks Version Database Compiler, a text file
is produced that can be imported in the BibleWorks Version Database Compiler
for display in BibleWorks. See the BibleWorks online help for detailed
information.</p>

<h4><a name="openscriptureinformationstandard"></a>Open Scripture Information
Standard</h4>

<p>An attempt is made to produce a valid OSIS file. The standard transformation
is the recommended one. Or if the OSIS file is going to be used for creating a
Go Bible, you can produce a variant for the Go Bible Creator.</p>

<h4><a name="crosswiresword"></a>Crosswire SWORD</h4>

<p>When exporting to a SWORD module, the module is created and installed
straightaway. Normally Bibledit will install the SWORD module to subdirectory
.sword in the home directory, but this can be changed. Provide a name for the
module and export it. After restarting the Sword enabled Bible reader, the
module should be visible in the program.</p>

<p>While creating a Sword module, <a href="olh_sword_module.html">some settings
need to be made.</a></p>

<p>Module path is the directory where a zipped module will be stored. This
module is fit for immediate distribution.</p>

<p>Exporting to SWORD produces an intermediate OSIS file, which is placed in
the home directory. This file will be compiled by osis2mod, the SWORD
compiler.</p>

<p>Currently there are two methods for exporting to an OSIS file and a Sword
module. There is the "Old method". This divides the text into books, chapters
and verses. Then there's the "Recommended transformation". This divides the
text into books, sections and paragraphs. At the moment of writing the osis2mod
compiler is not capable of producing a proper Sword module out of the OSIS file
created with the new method.</p>

<p>If one method fails to produce the result that you'd like to see, try the
other one.</p>

<p>You can also export to an OSIS variant that is fit for the Go Bible
Creator.</p>

<h4><a name="opendocument"></a>OpenDocument</h4>

<p>This will ask you where to save the file, and then does the export. The file
can be opened in the various wordprocessors that support OpenDocument, such as
AbiWord, KWord, OpenOffice, etc. The main purpose of this export is to be able
to transfer the formatted text into other applications. For that reason several
style settings, like two columns, are unsupported.</p>

<h4>Go Bible</h4>

<p>This will create a Go Bible. It runs on a cell phone. However, some extra
software needs to be installed on your computer for this to work. First you
need to have a Java runtime environment. This can be installed through your
distribution's software installation mechanism. Secondly you need to download
the Go Bible Creator, and put that into your home folder. In order to do that,
browse to <a href="http://gobible.jolon.org/">http://gobible.jolon.org</a>,
click the Developer link, click on GoBibleCreator, and then download the
GoBibleCreator zip file. There's no need to unpack it, only to put it in the
home folder, that is sufficient.</p>

<h3><a name="references"></a>References</h3>

<p>You can export all the references that are now in the References Area. This
saves them to a file on disk, one references per line.</p>

<h3><a name="stylesheet"></a>Stylesheet</h3>

<p>You can export the stylesheet. The one that displays will be exported.</p>

<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>

<p>You can export the notes and save them to file in a format that is easily
readable.</p>

<h3><a name="links"></a>Links</h3>

<p><a href="questions.html">Questions.</a></p>
