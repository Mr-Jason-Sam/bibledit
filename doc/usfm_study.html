<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>The following represents a proposal for the USFM markup requirements
within a Paratext 6 study Bible authoring environment. The examples used
within this proposal are based on the text of the Good News Study Bible, with
additional note materials taken from the CEV Learning Bible.</p>
<p>This proposal is based on an inventory or markers used for existing study
Bible projects ongoing within the Asia-Pacific region (December 2003). A
description of the existing AP authoring markup is available in AP SFC for
SB.doc. Paratext 6 Project Configuration</p>
<p>Proposal: Content for study Bibles is split into three related Paratext
project windows.</p>
<p>1. One project contains the scripture text, and references the usfm.sty
stylesheet.</p>
<p>2. One project contains extended study "footnotes", and references the
usfm_sb-notes.sty</p>
<p>These notes do not include the default set of footnotes in the associated
scripture text.</p>
<p>Notes include markup to indicate a category (note topic) to which the note
materials belongs. Categories are project specific and are not predefined in
USFM.</p>
<p>There are four distinct types of notes which may be included</p>
<p>* study notes for verses</p>
<p>* study notes for words</p>
<p>* study notes for keyterms</p>
<p>* callouts</p>
<p>3. One project contains sidebars and devotional/reflection material, and
references usfm_sb-sidebars.sty.</p>
<h3><a name="markupforthenotesproject"></a>Markup for the Notes Project</h3>
<p>The Paratext project containing extended study notes will include all
chapter markers (\c), and selected verse (\v) markers for verses containing
notes. Extended Notes</p>
<p>Extended note markers are configured as paragraph styles and indicate the
start of one of four note types using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>\en?_\cat_&lt;category name&gt;_\ft study note content...\en?*</pre>
<p>where:</p>
<p>* \env - Indicates the beginning of a study relating to the entire
verse.</p>
<p>* \enw - Indicates the beginning of a study note relating to a word or
words within the verse.</p>
<p>* \enk - Indicates the beginning of a study note relating to a keyterm
appearing within the verse.</p>
<p>* \enc - Indicates the beginning of a study note callout.</p>
<p>* \cat - Indicates the category to which a note belongs.</p>
<p>o &lt;category name&gt; is replaced with the text for a category name (or
number) being used in the study Bible project.</p>
<p>* study note content - Everything that is part of the extended study
note.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the amount of new markup introduced for study Bibles,
the note content should use the existing USFM footnote markers for defining
its content elements.</p>
<p>The following footnote markers are included within the current
usfm_sb-notes.sty stylesheet for use within study note content (the \Name
field for these markers within usfm_sb-notes.sty is changed from usfm.sty to
indicate its purpose within a study note:</p>
<p>* \ft - Study note text</p>
<p>* \fk - Study note keyword</p>
<p>* \fq - Study note translation quotation or alternate rendering</p>
<p>* \fqa - Study note translation alternate rendering</p>
<p>* \fv - Study note embedded verse number</p>
<p>* \fdc - Study note DC text application only</p>
<p>A single cross-reference element is also included for the purpose of
marking references within note text to other scripture or note passages (see
examples).</p>
<p>\xt - Cross reference target references</p>
<p>Other standard USFM markup which may be used include:</p>
<p>* \w - Wordlist/Glossary/Dictionary reference</p>
<p>* \nd, \bk, \tl, \pn - Name of Deity, Quoted book title, Transliterated
word, Proper name</p>
<p>* \no, \it, \bd, \bdit, \sc - Various character styles (use is strongly
discouraged)</p>

\ip The opening words of \bk The Gospel according to Mark\bk*
tell its readers that the subject of this book is the Good
News about Jesus Christ. With the coming of Jesus Christ,
it announces, the time set by God to bring salvation to humankind
has arrived (1.15). Though the book concentrates on his deeds and
words, it is not a biography of Jesus of Nazareth. Only one year,
or a little more, of Jesus' life appears to be recorded (chapters
1--10), and over one-third of the book (chapters 11--16) is taken
up with the last week of Jesus in and near \w jerusalem\w*. Nothing
is said about his birth, childhood, home, or parents. When he first
appears, unknown and unannounced, Jesus is a full-grown adult who
comes to John the Baptist to be \w baptized\w* by him.
\ip The author's primary interest in writing is religious. The
Gospel is written "from \w faith\w* to faith". Arising out of
the faith of the Christian community in Jesus as \w messiah\w*,
Saviour, and Lord, it seeks to strengthen and build that faith by
recounting his words and deeds. Principally, it records his
voluntary sacrifice for the salvation of many people (10.45).
This religious interest means that, while the author was concerned
to report historically what Jesus said and did during his public
ministry in Galilee and Jerusalem, he was not aiming to report all
that took place, or to stick rigidly to the order in which things
happened.
\ip This Gospel is as relevant to the Christian community of today
as it was to the original first-century readers...</pre>
<pre>\s1 The Story
\ip \bk Mark's\bk* story of Jesus is told quickly and with an
abundance of details that enhance its dramatic impact. Jesus
appears suddenly in Judea, where he joins those who are being
baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist. Just as suddenly,
he returns to Galilee, where he proclaims the message that the
\w kingdom of god\w* is about to arrive...</pre>
<pre>\ip However, he is more than a teacher, healer, or
\w miracle\w*-worker. He is also the Messiah, the Son of God,
the Son of Man. These three titles express the first Christians'
understanding of who Jesus is.
\li 1 \k The Messiah\k* is the one promised by God, the one who would
come and free God's people. By the time \bk The Gospel of Mark\bk*
appeared, the title "Messiah" (in Greek, "\w christ\w*") had become
a proper name, so that the Gospel opens with "the Good News about Jesus
Christ" (and not "Jesus the Christ"). Peter's confession (8.29) marks
a turning-point in the ministry of Jesus. The title "\w son of
david\w* " (10.46-48) also identifies Jesus as the Messiah, who
would restore to Israel the power and glory it enjoyed under David's
reign (also 12.35-37).
\li 2 \k The Son of God\k* is the title by which the heavenly voice
addresses Jesus at his baptism (1.11) and his transfiguration (9.7).
And at Jesus' death the Roman officer confesses that Jesus is the
Son of God (15.39).
\li 3 \k The Son of Man\k* is the title most often used of Jesus, and
it appears only on the lips of Jesus. This enigmatic title appears in
\bk The Book of Daniel\bk* (Dan 7.13n), where it is applied to the
exalted figure to whom God gives universal dominion. In \bk Mark\bk*
the title is used of Jesus in three ways: the Son of Man acts with
divine power (2.10, 28); he will be rejected, will suffer and die
(8.31; 9.9, 12, 31; 10.33-34, 45; 14.21, 41); he will return in
power and glory (8.38; 13.26; 14.62).</pre>

notes would be placed. In the case of notes relating to words, it may be
desirable to somehow surround or highlight the word(s) being noted with some
type of marker. In this image right and left pointing wedges are being used
as an example. It may also be acceptable to simply add a caller to the end of
a verse containing one or more notes. In this image an asterisk is being used
as an example.</p>
<h3><a name="extendedintroductionnoncanonicalmaterial"></a>Extended Introduction/Non-Canonical Material</h3>
<p>Extended book, division, and section introductions present in a study
Bible should be included in the Extended Notes project.</p>
<p>Markup and text from the source/reference scripture resource for
non-canonical items such as section heads (\s) and parallel references (\r),
should be included in the Extended Notes project in order to indicate the
correct location for additional or alternative non-canonical material at that
location. When texts are merged for publication the non-canonical material
from the note project will replace the source/reference scripture resource
material.</p>

<pre>\ms Jesus' Public Ministry in Galilee
\mr 1.14--9.50
\ip Jesus returns to Galilee and does not go back to
Judea until the close of his public ministry. There is
no indication of how long his Galilean ministry lasted:
only when he is back in Judea is a \w festival\w*
(\w passover\w*) mentioned (14.1). He spends much
of his time in Capernaum (1.21; 2.1; 3.1, 20; 9.33) and
other places around Lake Galilee (1.9; 2.13; 3.7; 4.1).
Twice Jesus ventures out of Galilee: into the region of
the Ten Towns (5.1-20) and Phoenicia (7.24-31). His
actions and teachings soon arouse opposition from the
religious leaders (2.6-7, 24; 3.6, 22; 7.1-13; 8.11-12),
and before long he predicts his coming arrest,
condemnation, and crucifixion (8.31; 9.30-31).
\s1 Jesus Calls Four Fishermen
\r (Mt 4.12-22; Lk 4.14-15; 5.1-11)
\ip Jesus' message is about the arrival of the \w kingdom
of god\w*, which will happen soon. To prepare for it, the
people need to repent (1.15). He immediately summons
two pairs of fishermen brothers to be his followers and
helpers.

<h3><a name="markupforthesidebarsproject"></a>Markup for the Sidebars Project</h3>
<p>The Paratext project containing sidebars (including devotional/reflection
questions) will include all chapter markers (\c), and selected verse (\v)
markers indicating the start and end of sidebar material.</p>
<p>If a verse number is written as a range, this indicates that the study
content belongs near to (associated with) that range of scripture text.</p>
<p>Note: Extended book, division, and section introductions present in a
study Bible should be included in the Extended Notes project.</p>
<p>Two additional paragraph elements are used to mark the start of sidebar
and reflective-question material. These markers also serve to mark the
heading for the material.</p>
<p>* \esb - Indicates the beginning of sidebar text (a heading).</p>
<p>* \erq - Indicates the beginning of reflection question/devotional text (a
heading).</p>
<p>All the markers used within these environments must be USFM Introduction
Element markers. The following markers are included in the
usfm_sb-sidebars.sty stylesheet. The descriptive name for each marker has
been changed slightly to better reflect their use within the study material
context.</p>
<p>* imt, imt1, is, is1, is2, iot, io1, io2, io3, io4, ip, im, ipi, imi, ipq,

\esb Fish and Fishing
\ip In Jesus' time, fishing took place mostly on lake Galilee, because Jewish people could not use many of
the harbors along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, since these harbors were often controlled by unfriendly
neighbors. The most common fish in the Lake of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of Moses allowed people
to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to
be eaten (\xt Lev 11.9-12\xt*). Fish were also probable brought from Tyre and Sidon, where they were dried
and salted.
\ip The creation story tells that God ordered the waters of the earth to bring forth fish along with all other
kinds of sea plants and animails (\xt Gen 1.20-22\xt*). God gave human beings control over creation, including
fish (\xt Gen 1.28; Psa 8.6-8\xt*), but people are forbidden to make or worship and image of any created thing,
including fish (\xt Deu 4.15-18\xt*). When God renews the creation, the salty Dea Sea will become fresh water
and will be filled with fish (\xt Ezk 47.7-10\xt*).
\p Fishing was also and important source of jobs and income in Galilee, and several of Jesus' followers were
fishermen. Jesus told them that they were going to bring in people instead of fish (\xt Mrk 1.16,17; Mat
4.18,19\xt*). When Jesus fed the hungry crowd that followed him out of town, the food he provided was bread and
fish (\xt Mrk 6.30-44; Mat 14.14-21; Luk 9.10-17\xt*). Jesus used fishing to show his disciples the amazing
results they could expect from having faith in him and sharing the good news with others. the net the apostles
thre into the lake became so full of fish that they could not pull it into their boat (\xt Jhn 21.4-12\xt*).
\ip Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because the Greek word for fish
(\tl ichthus\tl*) consists of the first letters of the Greek words that tell who Jesus is:
\fig Christian Fish Image|christfish.jpg||||Ihsous Christos Theou Uios Swthr|\fig*

<p>Note: The image below displays the scripture body, and study note context
for the sidebar material example above. Sidebars are typically presented at
the bottom of a page, below the extended notes. However, figures might be
presented elsewhere (such as in a column at the page edge).</p>

\erq Questions About Mark 1
\ili 1. \bk Mark\bk* begins with the words, "This is the good
news about Jesus Christ." What exactly is this "good news"?
Give two or three examples from the first nine chapters to
support your definition.
\ili 2. \bk Mark\bk* tells how Jesus healed many people. For
example, read 1.40-45. Who did Jesus heal? What did he tell
the man "not" to do? Why? What happened anyway?
