<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Bibledit can print things like a list of references along with the text,
or the project.</p>
<p>Printing is done this way: Bibledit generates a .pdf file, and then opens
this file in a pdf viewer. From there it can be printed.</p>
<h3><a name="font"></a>Font</h3>
<p>The font to be used can be set under menu View / Printer font. To use a
font, put a tick in the "Use" column.</p>
<p>The size of the fonts can be set too.</p>
<p><a href="glossary.html#xep">XEP</a> cannot handle all fonts. At present it
handles True Type fonts (that end with a .ttf extension), and Adobe Type 1
fonts (ending with a .pfa or .pfb extension) and that have an accompanying
metrics file that ends with a .afm extension.</p>
<p>If the font you need is not available on your operating system, you may
want to check out <a href="http://scripts.sil.org">http://scripts.sil.org</a>
for additional fonts or search the internet for "Free Unicode fonts".</p>
<p>If XEP does not render a certain character, it means the font you have
chosen does not contain a glyph for this particular character. Try another
font, or use more than one font at once.</p>
<h3><a name="usingseveralfonts"></a>Using several fonts</h3>
<p>To use several fonts, tick all the fonts you wish to use.</p>
<p>This means that Bibledit will not use only one font for printing, but
other fonts as well.</p>
<p>If the text you wish to print has many different characters, it may be
that there is not one single font that contains glyphs for them all. While
XEP formats the text, it looks through all the fonts you have specified,
starting at the top, to find the glyph to print. This character will be
printed in the first font that contains that glyphs.</p>
<p>It will be clear that because of this the printing will take much
longer.</p>
<p>You can reorder the fonts in the list. Drag the most important font to the
top, and the less important ones under it.</p>
<p>If XEP does not render a certain character, that means that there is no
font installed on your system that is supported by XEP and contains this
character, or there is a font but it is disabled. This can be the case even
though the character displays properly in the editor with that font. This is
because when a character is not found in a font, Bibledit searches through
the other fonts until the character has been found, and the other fonts may
include fonts that are not supported by XEP.</p>
<h3><a name="problematicfonts"></a>Problematic fonts</h3>
<p>Some operating systems install fonts that are not Unicode compliant, or
that have license restrictions, or that have other problems. If Bibledit
gives a message during printing that there was a problem, you can have a look
in the System log if the problem was caused by some offending fonts. These
fonts should be disabled in the font selection dialog for printing. Fonts can
be disabled by dragging them below the "Disabled Fonts Below" line.</p>
<h3><a name="lineheight"></a>Line height</h3>
<p>In the dialog where the font can be selected, there is also a setting for
the line height, in percentages. Normally it is on 100%. Setting it to e.g.
200% gives the line a double height. This would for example allow for text
and notes to be written between the lines on worksheets.</p>
<h3><a name="formatter"></a>Formatter</h3>
<p>Bibledit needs an xslfo formatter to lay the text out on the page. It uses
<a href="glossary.html#xep">XEP.</a></p>
<h3><a name="biblenotes"></a>Bible notes</h3>
<p>These are <a href="biblenotes.html">footnotes, endnotes, and
crossreferences.</a></p>
<h3><a name="locationofpdffiles"></a>Location of .pdf files</h3>
<p>The .pdf file for printing a project is usually found in the <a
href="internals.html#temporaldirectory">temporary
directory</a>/project/document.pdf, and the one for printing references in
the <a href="internals.html#temporaldirectory">temporary
directory</a>/references/document.pdf.</p>
<h3><a name="columns"></a>Columns</h3>
<p>Normally text is laid out in two columns. The stylesheet editor allows the
"span columns" property to be set. This means that a certain piece of content
spans the two columns. Biblical content honours this setting, but content
from the Front Matter and the Back Matter is laid out in one column.</p>
<h3><a name="newpages"></a>New pages</h3>
<p>Normally Bibledit prints all the books one after the other, without
starting them on a new page. This behaviour is implemented so that normally
not too much paper is used. Bibledit can be set to print each new book on a
new page, or, going one step further, to have each book start on an odd page.
Settings for this are in the stylesheet, under the \id marker.</p>
<h3><a name="notprintingstyles"></a>Not printing styles</h3>
<p>Some styles have the "print" property in the stylesheet editor. If "print"
is unticked, then this style won't be printed. This comes in useful when
there is some data in the text that you don't want to print this time.
Footnotes, for example. The quickest way of doing this is to make two
stylesheets. One full stylesheet that prints everything. And one adapted
stylesheet that doesn't print footnotes. Just opening another stylesheet in
the editor, and printing, makes it work.</p>
<h3><a name="hyphenation"></a>Hyphenation</h3>
<p>Normally words are not hyphenated. But if a word does not look well on the
printout, and hyphenation is needed, the user can insert a soft hyphen in
that word. The "Insert" menu caters for that.</p>
