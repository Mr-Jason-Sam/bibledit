<h3><a name="recentcode"></a>Recent code</h3>

<p>The code is stored in a git repository. The repository is accessible from
the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit">Savannah Project
Page</a>. To view the code on the web, click on "Source Code" - and then
"Browse Sources Repository" just below "Use Git". To use the repository in
another way, click on "Source Code" - "Use Git". It will give some
information there.</p>

<p>Recent code can be checked out from the repository. This code gives the
latest versions of Bibledit. Every night this code is updated, hence it
contains the nightly builds. This code has not been thoroughly tested, but is
supported, and give you a great way to follow the newest and latest
developments in Bibledit.</p>

<p>In order to get the most recent code, do the following in a terminal.</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/bibledit</pre>

<p>The above command clones the code repository to your local disk. It will
create a directory called "bibledit". Go into that directory, and do the
normal "./configure", "make", "sudo make install" sequence, as is described
for <a href="install_bibledit.html">installing bibledit</a>.</p>

<p>Note 1. To save bandwidth, it is recommended to leave the directory
"bibledit", created above, as it is. If that directory is left there, then
next time there is no need to clone the whole repository. Just pulling the
changes is enough:</p>
<pre>cd bibledit
git reset --hard
git pull
./configure
make
sudo make install</pre>

<p>Formerly if anybody wished to run what was then called nightly builds
needed to download the full build each time. The current method saves a lot
of bandwidth, because it downloads the changes only, and these changes are
usually small.</p>

<p>Note 2. For best results close Bibledit while installing the new
version.</p>

<p>Note 3. This also works for updating/upgrading to full versions where the
version number is x.x. But there is a good change that the version that you
get will be a newer version, like x.x.1 or x.x.2.</p>

<h3><a name="helpneeded"></a>Help needed</h3>

<p>Help in developing Bibledit is welcome.</p>

<p>* Do you like writing good documentation? Your help is welcome to maintain
the helpfiles of Bibledit.</p>

<p>* You know how useful packages are? Making packages could be the thing you
would like to help with.</p>

<p>* Are you good at testing? Your feedback is welcome and suggestions for
new features too.</p>

<h3><a name="bugsandfeaturerequests"></a>Bugs and feature requests</h3>

<p>Savannah.nongnu.org provides resources for developing Bibledit. The <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit">Savannah Project Page</a>
is the central point from where all these resources can be accessed.</p>

<p>To report a problem go to the <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit">Savannah Project
Page</a>, and click on "Bugs". A list of open bugs will show, and you can see
whether your bug has been reported already. If not, click "Bugs" - "Submit",
fill in the screen with detailed information on when the bug occurs, and the
steps to be taken to reproduce it, and any other information that may be
useful, and click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the screen. You need
to open an account to do this, and then you'll be emailed whenever this bug
is attended to.</p>

<p>Asking for a new feature works similar. Click on "Tasks". A list of tasks,
that is, feature requests, will appear. If the feature you wish to have it
not yet in, click "Tasks" - "Submit", and submit a new task.</p>

<p>When submitting bug reports it is sometimes useful to include your
configuration and data. This allows the programmer or tester to reproduce
your bug, and so fix it. In a terminal type</p>
<pre>tar -czf bibledit.tar.gz .bibledit</pre>

<p>to create a file called bibledit.tar.gz. This file can be attached to the
bug report.</p>

<h3><a name="howitstarted"></a>How it started</h3>

<p>It started with an entry in the programmer's diary:</p>

<p>* Friday 30 May 2003. I made the decision to move from Windows to Linux.
God will help here, and the future will show why this decision had to be
taken. A lot of programming needs to be done to move the Bible translation
programs to Linux.</p>

<p>I remember that at that time I had lost peace with God for a good while,
was in great unrest of mind, and examined myself thoroughly what it was, and
then came to the above decision. It seemed to me a bit an unusual cause for
this unrest, but nevertheless I could not find another one. After the
decision was made and the actual move, I regained my peace.</p>

<p>In 2004 some programming efforts were made to synchronize data between
Paratext on Windows and Linux storage, and as I forsaw a greater future for
this program, I called it Bibledit.</p>

<p>After that I had a health breakdown and lost my energy, and was not able
to contribute to Bibledit and had to lay down to rest during the breaks of
our regular translation work. Then we as a family changed our lifestyle, and
God restored my energy to the level I had in the days of my youth.</p>

<p>From then on programming in Bibledit went in high gear, others started to
contribute, and the project moved forward to where it is now.</p>

<h3><a name="usingthedebugger"></a>Using the debugger</h3>

<p>When working with support to troubleshoot a program, a core file may be
requested.</p>

<p>A core file is a file created by the operating system when a program
terminates unexpectedly, encounters a bug, or violates the operating system's
protection mechanisms.</p>

<p>By default core files are not created on some Linux systems. Whether or
not the operating system creates core files is controlled by the ulimit
command. To see the current ulimit setting for core files, do the
following:</p>
<pre>ulimit -c
0</pre>

<p>The ulimit command sets limits on the resource available to the bash
shell. The -c parameter controls the size of core files. The value 0
indicates that core files are not created. To enable core file creation,
increase the size limit of core files to a number greater than zero. For
example:</p>
<pre>ulimit -c 50000</pre>

<p>allows core files and limits the file size to 50000 bytes.</p>

<p>If you need to enable core file creation temporarily to create a core file
for a problem application, increase the ulimit at the command line and then
run the application.</p>

<p>When bibledit segfaults and leaves a core dump file, you can use gdb to
look at the program state when it crashed. Use the core command to load a
core file.The argument to the core command is the filename of the core dump
file, which is usually "core.&lt;pid&gt;", making the full command core
core.&lt;pid&gt;.</p>
<pre>prompt &gt; bibledit
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
prompt &gt; gdb bibledit
...
(gdb) core core.&lt;pid&gt;
...</pre>

<p>If bibledit crashes repeatedly, an easier way is to start bibledit through
the debugger, and then use the backtrace command to see what happened and
when.</p>

<p>Open bibledit in the debugger:</p>
<pre>gdb bibledit</pre>

<p>Run it:</p>
<pre>(gdb) run</pre>

<p>If there is a problem, bibledit will freeze. Switch to the debugger, which
has stopped. View the stack:</p>
<pre>(gdb) backtrace</pre>

<p>Pls. mail the developer and inform him about what you see and when it
happened.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>On Cygwin, gdb might get stopped and return you to the terminal. Enter
"fg" to get the program back.</p>
