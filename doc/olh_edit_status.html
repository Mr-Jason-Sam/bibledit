<h2><a name="editstatus"></a>Edit Status</h2>
<p>This dialog is accessible through the menu / Edit / Status.</p>
<p>Bibledit supports simple project status reporting. In this dialog the
status of a project or part of the project can be set.</p>
<p>The dialog consists of four columns.</p>
<p>The first column is "Status of project". That column shows one row
consisting of a button and a progress bar. The progress bar gives a rough
idea of how far the project has progressed to completion. If the user clicks
the progressbar / button, then dialog "<a href="olh_set_status.html">Set
Status</a>" displays. The user can set the status of the whole project here.
If for example task "Village Check" is ticked as completed, then all books in
the project, and all chapters in each book, and all verses in each chapter
will have their task "Village Check" done.</p>
<p>The second column is "Status of books". All the books in the project show
there. If a book is clicked for the first time, then all chapters in that
book show up, and how far they have been completed. If then a book is clicked
for the second time, the dialog "<a href="olh_set_status.html">Set
Status</a>" displays, and the user can set the status for that whole book.
Any changes in the status setting propagate to all the children, that is, to
all chapters in that book and all verses.</p>
<p>The third column is "Status of chapters". All the chapters in the selected
book show up. If clicking it for the first time, the verses in that chapter
show, and if clicked for the second time, the status can be set.</p>
<p>The last column is "Status of verses". All the verses in the selected
chapter show up. Clicking on a button / progressbar allows the user to set
the status for that individual verse.</p>
