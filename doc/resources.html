<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Bibledit allows you to view Resources that scroll in sync with
Bibledit.</p>

<p>If Bibledit shows a certain verse, the Resource will show the same
verse.</p>

<h3><a name="operation"></a>Operation</h3>

<p>A new Resource can be opened through File / Resource / Open.</p>

<p>A Resource that has the focus can be closed through File / Resource /
Close. </p>

<p>A new Resource can be created through <a href="olh_resource_new.html">File
/ Resource / New</a>.</p>

<p>A Resource that has the focus can be edited through <a
href="olh_resource_new.html">File / Resource / Edit</a>.</p>

<p>A Resource can be deleted through File / Resource / Delete.</p>

<p>To let the Resource scroll together with Bibledit, tick the appropriate
box in menu Preferences / Reference exchange.</p>

<h3><a name="templates"></a>Templates</h3>

<p>Bibledit uses templates to display resources. Each resource has its own
template. There are some templates that come with Bibledit. These can be
edited. The user can also create and edit his own templates.</p>

<h3>Cache</h3>

<p>Any web page that has ever been displayed as a resource will be stored in
the cache. This means that any web page that is available externally will be
fetched only once. After that any subsequent calls for the same page will
retrieve it from the cache. </p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach. </p>

<p>To start with the advantages, it means that any web page that has been
displayed as a resource automatically becomes available for off-line viewing
too. This allows for taking the software to remote areas and have full access
to resources even without an internet connection. To make a web page
available off-line it must have been viewed at least once. No provision has
yet been made for automatically viewing every single reference, from Genesis
to Revelation, so that the whole resource would become available off-line.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that the web page is available immediately, no matter
how slow the internet connection. </p>

<p>A disadvantage is that it thus uses more space on disk. Another
disadvantage is that once a web page has been retrieved, and subsequently the
web page changes on the internet, the change will not be seen by the user.
This can be resolved by manually emptying the cache. The cache is available
at /home/joe/.bibledit/htmlcache.</p>
