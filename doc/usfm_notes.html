<h3><a name="footnoteandendnotesyntax"></a>Footnote and Endnote Syntax</h3>
<h4><a name="ffootnote"></a>\f * Footnote</h4>
<p>Footnotes are built in the following way:</p>
<p>\f_footnotes caller_footnote content\f*</p>
<p>They consist of these four parts:</p>
<p>1. \f: (initial marker) starts the footnote.</p>
<p>2. footnote caller: may be one of these three:</p>
<p>* + means that the caller is generated automatically, eg. progressive
letters or numbers.</p>
<p>* - means no caller is generated.</p>
<p>* * means any character, where * represents the character to be used as
the caller â€“ defined by the user.</p>
<p>3. footnote content:</p>
<p>* Everything that is part of the footnote.</p>
<p>* This will contain the footnote text, reference, and any additional
footnote elements (keywords, quotations etc.)</p>
<p>* Each element should be prefixed by the relevant back-slash code listed
below.</p>
<p>4. \f*: (final marker) ends the footnote</p>
<h4><a name="feendnote"></a>\fe * Endnote</h4>
<p>Endnotes are built in the same way as footnotes:</p>
<p>\fe_endnotes caller_endnote content\fe*</p>
<p>See the f marker above for explanation.</p>
<p>More information is in the section about the <a
href="biblenotes.html">biblenotes</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="fmfootnotemark"></a>\fm * Footnote Mark</h4>
<p>\fm_...\fm*_</p>
<p>* Footnote mark.</p>
<p>* Used in a situation where two or more points in the text need to refer
to the same footnote as seen in Gen 2.9 and Gen 2.17.</p>
<p>* Important: Not to be used in scripture authoring. Intended for use
during the publishing process.</p>
<h4><a name="exampleofusegen29and217"></a>Example of use (Gen 2.9 and 2.17):</h4>
<pre>\v 9 He made all kinds of beautiful trees grow there and produce good fruit.
In the middle of the garden stood the tree that gives life and the tree that
gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. \f i \fr 2.9: \fq knowledge
of what is good and what is bad; \ft or \fq knowledge of everything.\f*</pre>
<p>and later in the file</p>
<pre>\v 17 except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is
bad. \fm i \fm* You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do, you will
die the same day.?</pre>
<p>* When markers have not been predefined (i.e. when the \f + format is
being used), reference footnote text used earlier in the current book by
specifying chapter and verse.</p>
<pre>\v 17 except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is
bad. \fm 2.9 \fm* You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do, you will
die the same day.?</pre>
<h3><a name="footnotecontentelements"></a>Footnote Content Elements</h3>
<p>The following codes can be included as part of the footnote content:</p>
<h4><a name="frreference"></a>\fr (*) Reference</h4>
<p>\fr_##.##</p>
<p>* Footnote reference.</p>
<p>* The chapter and verse(s) that note refers to.</p>
<h4><a name="fkkeyword"></a>\fk (*) Keyword</h4>
<p>\fk_</p>
<p>* Footnote keyword.</p>
<p>* The specified word(s) for which the footnote is being provided.</p>
<h4><a name="fqquotation"></a>\fq (*) Quotation</h4>
<p>\fq_</p>
<p>* Quotation from the scripture text.</p>
<p>* The current and/or alternative translations of a portion of the
scripture text.</p>
<h4><a name="fqaalternativetranslation"></a>\fqa (*) Alternative translation</h4>
<p>\fqa_</p>
<p>* Alternative translation.</p>
<p>* To be used when it is preferable to distinguish between a quotation of
the current translation of the scripture text, and an alternative translation
(instead of using \fq for marking both of these elements).</p>
<h4><a name="fllabelledtext"></a>\fl (*) Labelled Text</h4>
<p>\fl_</p>
<p>* A footnote label text item.</p>
<p>* For marking or "labelling" a word or words which are used consistently
across certain types of translation notes (such as the words "Or" in an
alternate translation note, "Others", "Heb.", "LXX" etc.).</p>
<h4><a name="fpadditionalparagraph"></a>\fp (*) Additional Paragraph</h4>
<p>\fp_</p>
<p>* A footnote additional paragraph marker.</p>
<p>* Use this marker to indicate the start of a new paragraph within a
footnote.</p>
<p>* In order to display a new line (in Paratext formatted view) before the
start of a new footnote paragraph, add a soft-return before the \fp
marker.</p>
<h4><a name="fvverseintext"></a>\fv (*) Verse in Text</h4>
<p>\fv_</p>
<p>* Footnote verse number.</p>
<p>* A verse number in the the text being quoted in the footnote.</p>
<h4><a name="fttext"></a>\ft (*) Text</h4>
<p>\ft_</p>
<p>* Footnote text.</p>
<p>* The (explanatory) text of the footnote.</p>
<h4><a name="fdcapocrypha"></a>\fdc * Apocrypha</h4>
<p>\fdc_...\fdc*_</p>
<p>* Text between these markers is material to be included only in editions
that contain the Apocrypha.</p>
<h3><a name="examplesofuse"></a>Examples of use</h3>
<p>Example showing the caller within the body text (TEV Mrk 6.37):</p>
<pre>\p
\v 37 ?You yourselves give them something to eat,?
Jesus answered.
\p They asked, ?Do you want us to go and spend two hundred
silver coins \f j \fr 6.37: \fk silver coins: \ft A silver
coin was the daily wage of a rural worker (see Mt 20.2).\f*
on bread in order to feed them??</pre>
<p>Examples showing the footnote text (1Ch 4.9 ; Mrk 1.1; Mrk 6.11):</p>
<pre>\p
\v 9 There was a man named Jabez, who was the most respected
member of his family. His mother had given him the name Jabez,
\f i \fr 4.9: \fk jabez: \ft This name sounds like the Hebrew
for ?pain.?\f* because his birth had been very painful.</pre>

God. \f a \fr 1.1: \ft Some manuscripts do not have \fq the Son

\v 12 Forgive us the wrongs we have done,
\q2 as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us.</pre>
<h3><a name="nesting"></a>Nesting</h3>
<p>By default footnote codes are not nested (i.e. they are not embedded
within each other). The use of each new code cancels out the 'environment' of
the previous. However, an alternative markup may be used requiring each
internal marker to be explicitly closed (e.g. \f + \fk...\fk*...\f*.). The
examples below include variants which use the "nested", and "non-nested"
approach. The \ft code is used in the non-nested markup to indicate a return
to normal explanatory footnote text. If the nested approach is used, each
code must be explicitly closed, and the unmarked text within \f ..\f* is
assumed to be normal footnote text.</p>
<p>Additional examples of use (A=non-nested variant, B=nested variant):</p>
<pre>\f + Please refer to the illustration in Gen 1.\f*</pre>
<pre>\f + Some manuscripts do not include John 8:1-20.\f*</pre>

<pre>\f + \fr 10.14\fr* Probable text \fq and of Crete...descended;\fq* Hebrew \fq from

<h3><a name="footnotestructure"></a>Footnote structure</h3>
<p>There are footnotes that have no markers inside them at all, markers like
\ft, \fr, \fq, \fp, and so on. By default, all text between the footnote
markers \f and \f*, except the caller, is considered to be footnote text if
no markers are used inside a footnote. Example: </p>
<pre>\f * 1.3 The word house is used in a figurative sense.\f*</pre>
<p>All text between \f and \f* is footnote text. The first asterisk (*) here
is the footnote caller. It marks the footnote in the text.</p>
<p>There are also footnotes with double inside markers. One marker to open
that particular style, and another marker to close it. In this case each
initial marker, e.g. \fr, \fq, has it's corresponding endmarker within the
footnote. The footnote-text-marker \ft is not needed, as all text without the
marked text is automatically footnote text. Example: </p>
<pre>\f * \fr 1.3 \fr* The word \fq house \fq* is used in a figurative sense.\f*</pre>
<p>It is possible to use also the footnote text marker. Example: </p>
<pre>\f * \fr 1.3 \fr* \ft The word \ft* \fq house \fq* \ft is used in a figurative sense.\ft* \f*</pre>
<p>But this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The only case that \ft is needed is when footnotes have single inside
markers, that is, when no endmarkers are used. In this case the initial
marker is used, e.g. \fr, \ft , \fq, and the</p>
<p>following marker, including \f*, is considered as the endmarker.
Example:</p>
<pre>\f * \fr 1.3 \ft The word \fq house \ft is used in a figurative sense.\f*.</pre>
<p>- \fr is the footnote reference marker</p>
<p>- \ft is the footnote text marker</p>
<p>- \fq is the footnote quotation marker, or the alternate rendering
marker</p>
<p>Working with single footnote-inside markers (without end-markers) or with
pairs of it (adding the endmarker) depends on the technique you are using to
insert those markers. </p>
<p>- If you select and then change the styles within a footnote, then double
markup is useful. This corresponds to the way other software does it.</p>
<p>- If you decide on a style before typing, singe mark-up is better.</p>
