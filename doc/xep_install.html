<h2><a name="installxep"></a>Install XEP</h2>
<p>Request a license for the free Personal Edition of <a
href="glossary.html#xep">XEP</a> at <a
href="http://www.renderx.com/download/personal.html">http://www.renderx.com/download/personal.html.</a></p>
<p>The license key will be emailed to you.</p>
<p>Collect your email and follow the instructions it contains.</p>
<p>Once through, you will have two files:</p>
<p>license.xml</p>
<p>xep-x.x-yyyyyyyy-personal.zip" (x.x is the version number, and yyyyyyyy is
a date)</p>
<p>Place both of the files in your home directory:</p>
<p>Note. On Windows, place them in c:\cygwin\home\&lt;user&gt;. This is the
home directory from the point of view of Bibledit.</p>
<p>Don't bother to unzip the xep installation file. Bibledit will do that for
you when you install.</p>
<p>As you have put both files in your home directory, next time you start
Bibledit, it will find them, and install XEP on its own.</p>
<p>If XEP won't install, then go to menu Preferences, Formatter. In that
dialog there are four steps given. All of these steps are to show "Done".
Anything not yet done needs attention. Press the buttons and make settings
till they all show fine. Then press Ok, and XEP will be installed.</p>
<p>Note. If "Install or upgrade XEP" shows "Done", that means XEP has already
been installed, and there is no need to worry about anything that still
indicates "to do".</p>
