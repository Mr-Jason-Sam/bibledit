<p>This is a guideline of how to use SourceForge for development tracking in
bibledit.</p>
<h3><a name="featuresofthesourceforgereportingsystem"></a>Features of the SourceForge reporting system</h3>
<p>From the SourceForge tracking the following tools are used:</p>
<p>* Tracker: (Bug, Support Request, Patches, Feature Request) is for
bugreports and proposals/requests,</p>
<p>* Mail: (only one Data Type) is for appreciations and qestions and
procedural requests.</p>
<p>The Tracker tool has the following subsystems/dimensions:</p>
<p>* Data Type: Bug, Support Request, Patches, Feature Request, are split
(filtered) into four sets from beginning (when clicking Tracker)</p>
<p>* Category: general, None, check, find ... : Can be filtered out, open
set: (items can be added/changed)</p>
<p>* Assigned to: None, &lt;developer&gt; : Can be filtered out, open set:
(items can be added/changed)</p>
<p>* Status: Open, Closed, Deleted, Pending : Can be filtered out</p>
<p>* Group: None, v1.0(example) : Can be filtered out, open set: (items can
be added/changed)</p>
<p>* Priority: 1 - Lowest, 2, 3, 4, 5 - Medium, 6, 7, 8, 9 - Highest,</p>
<p>* Resolution: Accepted, Duplicate, Invalid, Later, None, Out of Date,
Postponed, Rejected, Remind, Postponed, Wont't fix, Works for me.</p>
<h3><a name="howthesourceforgereportingsystemcanbeused"></a>How the SourceForge reporting system can be used</h3>
<h4><a name="initialinformationreports"></a>Initial information/reports</h4>
<p>Tester: sends in a report and choses one of the following:</p>
<p>* Bug: Bug</p>
<p>* Support Request: --- (e.g. Installation of Bibledit in Suse 10.1,
Include Unicode characters in counting characters in a project)</p>
<p>* Patches: (only for programmers to submit a patch: programmed part of the
program)</p>
<p>* Feature Request: Proposal (e.g. build in a formatted view in BE)</p>
<p>* Mail: for Appreciation or Question</p>
<p>Remark: The initial (Tracker)-reports have only one Status:Open</p>
<p>Programmer: uses</p>
<p>* Mail: to announce new features (of new releases)</p>
<p>* (Bug/Support/Patches/Feature/Mail as a personal reminder?)</p>
<h4><a name="feedbackinformationreports"></a>Feedback information/reports</h4>
<p>Programmer has to work on it: Status:Open:</p>
<p>* Check Data Type: Bug, Support Request, Patches, Feature Request and
change, if necessary</p>
<p>* Resolution:Invalid: feedback from tester, continue to work on it,</p>
<p>* Resolution:None those are initial reports: Check and tag them</p>
<p>* Resolution:Postponed: Fix bug or comply with request in later version</p>
<p>* Resolution:Remind: Fix bug or comply with request in next
version/nightly built</p>
<p>Tester has to work on it: Status:Pending:</p>
<p>* Resolution:Duplicate, check if report corresponds to previous one</p>
<p>* Resolution:Fixed: check in newest released nightly update version,</p>
<p>* Resolution:Later: Check at a later time</p>
<p>* Resolution:Out of Date: Solved long time ago</p>
<p>* Resolution:Rejected: check progammer's refusal to request</p>
<p>* Resolution:Won't fix: check progammer's refusal to bug-fix</p>
<p>* Resolution:Works for me: Check it again</p>
<p>Resolution:Accepted (only for Status:Patches) changes to Status:Done</p>
<p>No more work needed any more: Status:Done:</p>
<p>* There is nothing to do (any more) on this subject.</p>
<p>Status neither Open, Done or Pending: Status:Deleted</p>
<p>* This is only for marking a report, that it does not belong to one of the
other 3 categories: Open/Done/Pending</p>
<h3><a name="generalremarks"></a>General Remarks</h3>
<p>Category dimension: Categories are produced along the development and
testing of the program. Categories cannot be deleted, but changed
(renamed).</p>
<p>Group dimension could be used for marking versions, the problem is that
nightly builts are released nearly every day, so only main version should be
marked (0.9, 1.0, 1.1 ...)</p>
<p>Priority dimension should be marked: high for urgent things and low for
less important things. </p>
