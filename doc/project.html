<h3><a name="howtoprintaproject"></a>How to print a project?</h3>
<p>Printing a project goes via menu File - Print, then to select
"Project".</p>
<p>In that dialog you've the option to include or exclude certain books, and
to set which portion of any book will be printed. Remove the tick to exclude
it. Focus it, and then press the appropriate button to select the portion to
be printed.</p>
<p>Once printed it will open in a pdf viewer, and you can print the whole
project or part of it from there.</p>
<p>See also <a href="printing.html">Printing.</a></p>
<h3><a name="howtocompareaproject"></a>How to compare a project?</h3>
<p>A whole project can be compared to another one. Any differences are
highlighted.</p>
<p>Words that have been added are printed in bold. Words removed will appear
stroked out.</p>
<p>If only the changes are printed, then the references, that have a change,
will be loaded in the Reference Area for easy review.</p>
<h3><a name="howtoprintparallelversions"></a>How to print parallel versions?</h3>
<p>See the File menu, then menu Print, then Parallel Bible.</p>
<p>The so called "Parallel Bible" contains parallel versions for only one
book, and is intended for producing worksheets for use during translations
sessions. The members of the team each get a pile of sheets with all relevant
versions printed in parallel on it, verse by verse. Without these sheets each
member might have a lot of Bibles strewn about him on the desk, but with
these sheets things get more compact. And there will still be Bibles enough
on the desk, as many Bibles are not available in electronic format, and hence
cannot be printed on the worksheets.</p>
<p>Commentaries can also be printed on the worksheets, provided they are
available as projects in Bibledit.</p>
<p>The Parallel Bible will be printed with the currently opened project at
the top, and it will print the book that is currently opened. Therefore, to
change the first project on the sheets, just open another project, and for
changing the book to be printed, just go to another book.</p>
<p>To add another project to your Parallel Bible, press the "Add project"
button and select the project to be printed. Added projects can be removed
with the Remove button.</p>
<p>Normally all parallel verses are kept together on one page for greater
readability. Depending on the number of Bibles printed in parallel, this may
leave a lot of whitespace at the bottom of the page. To save paper you can
uncheck the option in the dialog, so that the parallel verses no longer are
kept together and the paper is filled with text to the bottom.</p>
<p>You can set which portion of the text to print. There are two controls
that influence this.</p>
<p>The "Change" button for the portion. This selects which portion to
print.</p>
<p>The "Include verses 0" checkbox, whether to include the verses 0 from any
of the chapters. Verse 0 is anything before verse 1.</p>
<p>At the end press button Ok to get the Bible in .pdf format.</p>
<h3><a name="howtomodifythechaptersinabookoftheproject"></a>How to modify the chapters in a book of the project?</h3>
<p>Add a new chapter to a book by inserting the "c" USFM marker, or by
choosing Insert - Chapter.</p>
<p>To remove a chapter from a book, choose Edit - Chapter number. In the
dialog that comes up, choose "Delete the chapter" and press OK. The chapter
that is currently visible will be deleted.</p>
<p>To change the number of a chapter, choose Edit - Chapter number. In the
dialog that comes up, choose a new chapter number from the list or enter it
manually, and then press OK.</p>
