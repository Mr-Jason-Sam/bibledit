<p>It is very important to make regular backup copies of your work, in
particular of the <a href="data_directory.html">data directory</a> of
Bibledit.</p>
<p>A good reason to store the data of Bibledit elsewhere, e.g. on a server,
can be for backup purposes. See the <a href="questions.html">Questions</a>
section for how to move it.</p>
<p>You can manually make backups of the project currently being opened in
Bibledit. See the <a href="olh_backup.html">Backup dialog</a>.</p>
