<h2><a name="backup"></a>Backup</h2>

<p>To keep your data safe, it is important to make regular backups of your
work. </p>

<p>To make it easy to create a backup, Bibledit provides the <a
href="olh_backup.html">Backup Assistant</a>. The Backup Assistant is available
in menu File / Backup. You can choose what you'd like to backup, whether a
Bible, the Notes, or Everything.</p>

<p>- Bible. When backup up a Bible, normally the Bible now focused in the
editor will be backed up. You can choose another one.</p>

<p>- Notes. When backing up Notes, all the available notes will be backed
up.</p>

<p>- Everything. Backing up everything really takes everything Bibledit knows
about. Depending on the number of Bibles that you have, it may take a good
while to create this backup.</p>

<p>The next step in the Backup Assistant is to choose the file where you'd like
the backup to be saved to.</p>

<p>If Bibledit starts, and notices that it has no data, it will ask for a
complete backup. A complete backup is one that was made with the "Everything"
option.</p>
