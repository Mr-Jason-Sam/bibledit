<h2><a name="backup"></a>Backup and Restore</h2>

<p>To keep your data safe, it is important to make regular backups of your
work. These backups can be restored if needed.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>

<p>To make it easy to make backups, Bibledit provides the Backup Assistant. The
Backup Assistant is available in menu File / Backup. You can choose what you'd
like to backup, whether a Bible, the Notes, or Everything.</p>

<p>- Bible. When backup up a Bible, normally the Bible now focused in the
editor will be backed up. You can choose another one.</p>

<p>- Notes. When backing up Notes, all the available notes will be backed
up.</p>

<p>- Everything. Backing up everything really takes everything Bibledit knows
about. Depending on the number of Bibles that you have, it may take a good
while to create this backup.</p>

<p>The next step in the Backup Assistant is to choose the file where you'd like
the backup to be saved to.</p>

<p>A backup can be restored through the Restore Assistant.</p>

<p>If Bibledit starts, and notices that it has no data, it will ask for a
complete backup. A complete backup is one that was made with the "Everything"
option.</p>

<h3>Restore</h3>

<p>The Restore Assistant helps you with restoring a backup. The assistant is
available through menu File / Restore. You can restore a Bible, or the Notes,
of Everything. When restoring everything, the data will be available after
restarting Bibledit.</p>

<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>

<p>- There are other ways of backing a Bible. You can make backups of the Bible
currently being opened in Bibledit. See the <a href="olh_backup.html">Backup
dialog</a>.</p>
