<h2><a name="bibledit"></a>Sword Module</h2>

<p>Bibledit can create a Sword module out of the USFM code. </p>

<p>This function is accessed through menu File / Project / Export / SWORD
module and OSIS file.</p>

<p>A dialog comes up where various settings can be made in relation to the
SWORD module to be produced.</p>

<p>Normally you can leave the settings in the dialog as they are. Changes can
be made, however.<a></a></p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p>This is the name for the module. The actual name given to the module
consists of the project name plus the name given here.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a short (1 line) description of the module, such as its title. The
actual description gets the project name prefixed.</p>

<h3>About</h3>

<p>This is a lengthier description and may include copyright, source, etc.
information. The actual description gets the project name prefixed.</p>

<h3>LCSH</h3>

<p>This is the Library of Congress Subject Heading. You may search the Library
of Congress catalog at <a
href="http://catalog.loc.gov/">http://catalog.loc.gov/</a> or use it as a guide
for determining an appropriate LCSH for books that are not in the Library of
Congress.</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<p>This describes the license under which the module is being distributed.</p>

<h3>Version</h3>

<p>This is the module's revision number of the module. Incrementing it when
changes are made alerts users of the SWORD Installers to the presence of
updated modules. Please start with version 1.0 and increment by 0.1 for minor
updates and by larger values for more major updates such as a new text
source.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>This is the primary language code of the module. You can enter a language by
hand, following certain official standards which are recognized in the Sword
system.</p>

<p>In Sword, they prefer to use ISO 639-1. These are two letter language codes.
For example, the code "en" stands for "English". If a language does not exist
in ISO 639-1, the ISO 639-2 standard can be used. If the language is not in
that standard, IANA registered codes can be used, then Ethnologue codes
(encoded as x-SIL-...), then ISO 639-3. The data for the latter is available at
http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp. All the language codes could have
been included in Bibledit, but to avoid bloat this was not done. The user who
wishes to uses a certain language needs to look its code up on the Internet,
following the standards mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Install path</h3>

<p>This is where Bibledit will install the module. This is the place where
Sword readers expect the module to be installed.</p>

<h3>Module path</h3>

<p>This is the directory where the module will be stored in zipped form. The
module is fit for immediate distribution.</p>
