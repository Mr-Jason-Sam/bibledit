<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Translators's Workplace provides Dictionaries, Commentaries and other useful
reference works.</p>
<p>If Translator's Workplace were to run properly on Linux through Wine, then
Bibledit would be sending references to it. There is an option for this in menu
Preferences - Reference exchange. It would be sending them through Bibledit
Windows Outpost. But as Translator's Workplace does not run properly on Linux,
none of this works.</p>
<h3><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h3>
<p>Ensure you've got <a href="install_wine.html">Wine installed.</a></p>
<p>Insert the Translator's Workplace CD-ROM in the drive and mount the
drive.</p>
<p>In the terminal type</p>
<pre>wine /media/cdrom/SETUP.EXE</pre>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen to install Translator's Workplace.</p>
<p>To copy infobases to your harddrive, copy them from the CD-ROM to the
directory where the infobases are supposes to be stored. Type</p>
<pre>cp /media/cdrom/NFO/* "/home/joe/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/SIL/TW4/nfo"</pre>
<p>where "joe" is your username.</p>
<p>Unmount the CD-ROM, insert the Library CD and mount the CD drive, and copy
all infobases on that CD also, using the same command.</p>
<h3><a name="use"></a>Use</h3>
<p>To run the program type</p>
<pre>wine "c:/Program Files/SIL/TW4/Views.exe"</pre>
<p>Once in Folio View, click the Open button and navigate to nfo, then open
TWMenu4.nfo, and things will be ready for use.</p>
<p>Clicking some links to open other infobases for some reason does not work,
but if these infobases are opened manually, they can be viewed.</p>
