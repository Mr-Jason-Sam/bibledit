Bibledit for OS X

Introduction

Bibledit has been working on OS X in various forms:
* Bibledit-Gtk written for Linux and ported to Mac OS X.
* Bibledit-Web written in PHP and adapted to run on Mac OS X.

The current port of Bibledit for OS X consists of the following parts:
* A native Bibledit OS X app.
* The bibledit library written in C++, compiled for OS X.
* The system web browser displaying pages through the bibledit library. 

The bibledit library depends on libcurl. Bibledit should be linked with some version of libcurl. Not all versions of libcurl work equally well.
* OS X 10.10 SDK libcurl.dylib: It initially works but after a few minutes of synchronizing with a Bibledit server it starts to time out, and stops working.
* Macports /opt/local/lib/libcurl.4.dylib: Works well.
* OS X 10.10 SDK libcurl.4.dylib: Works well.

Building the app for distribution:
Rename /opt/local to something else so it cannot link against any of those libraries.
Copy the Bibledit product from Xcode to another location.

Distributing the app:
Create a dmg in Disk Utility.
Add Bibledit.app to it.
Set the correct background image, and view options.
Create a link to /Applications, and add this link.
Convert the dmg to read-only.
