Bibledit-xiphos is glue between bibledit and xiphos

Bibledit-Xiphos can retrieve the focused reference through Bibledit-Web, 
and then forward it to Xiphos.

To make this work, do the following:

Install Bibledit-Web on your local computer or on the web.
Point Bibledit-Gtk to Bibledit-Web, so that it knows where 
to send its focused reference. 
The location of Bibledit-Web can be entered in Bibledit-Gtk under menu 
Preferences - Reference exchange. 
If Bibledit-Web would be installed locally, one could enter the local website,
e.g. http://localhost/bibledit.
Install Bibledit-Xiphos on your local computer.
Point Bibledit-Xiphos to Bibledit-Web. Entries can be made under Settings.

Once the above has been done, sharing of focused references should work.
